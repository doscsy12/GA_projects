    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
    "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",
    "5. Additional plots of your choosing.\n",
    "    - Are there any additional trends or relationships you haven't explored? Was there something interesting you saw that you'd like to dive further into? It's likely that there are a few more plots you might want to generate to support your narrative and recommendations that you are building toward. **As always, make sure you're interpreting your plots as you go**."

However, getting rid of them altogether is not beneficial to colleges who aims to determine the academic potential of incoming students. Furthermore, there could be a wide variation in grading standards between high schools. \n",
