    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "Therefore, the aim of this data analysis is to determine if both SAT and ACT scores have good predictive validity. Predictive validity is the measure in which test scores predict an outcome criteria. In other words, do SAT and ACT scores predict academic success in college students? Academic success in college is determined using the grade point average (GPA) of college students. GPA is calculated by using the number of grade points a student earns in a given period of semester or year in college. "

    "Many supporters of standardized tests have claimed that test scores are highly predictive of success in college. In providing test scores, the colleges have a standardized measure to determine academic readiness that can be used to compare students from different states and schools. There have been studies done to support this claim. One example is the University of California's Standardized Testing Task Force that found standardized tests to be the best predictor of a college student's success ([source](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/sttf-report.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, others have argued that academic success is heavily influenced by other factors such as family wealth, and to sorely rely on standardized test scores is unfair. A study by Dixon-Roman et al., 2013 reported that standardized tests are highly affected by the socioeconomic background of the students; They reported the lowest scores for each section of the SAT came from students with less than \\\\$20,000 in family income, while the highest scores came from families with more than \\\\$200,000 in income. Asian-American and Caucasian students also perform better than their Hispanic and African-American peers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280232788_Race_Poverty_and_SAT_Scores_Modeling_the_Influences_of_Family_Income_on_Black_and_White_High_School_Students%27_SAT_Performance)).\n",

This includes the plot of a histogram where the x-axis is the SAT scores divided into discrete bins (of 25) and the y-axis is the count of observations within each bin. The kde (kernel density estimation) plot smoothens the observations with a Gaussian kernel, producing an estimate of a continuous density plot. \n",

    "Admittedly, standardized tests are far from perfect. They cannot capture students' attitudes, such as being punctual to class, handing in assignments, etc. However, getting rid of them altogether is not beneficial to colleges who aims to determine the academic potential of incoming students. Furthermore, there could be a wide variation in grading standards between high schools. \n",
    "<br> The results here showed that there is a correlation between SAT scores and college GPA scores. Similarly, there is a correlation between ACT scores and college GPA scores. In addition, both SAT and ACT scores are similar in predicting future academic success in students entering college. \n",
    "<br> Unless there is a better way to predict a college student's success, removing standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT tests will not enable colleges to make better decisions during student admissions. Moreover, highly selective colleges who admits the most intelligent students, also produce high-performing graduates. \n"
