    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

    "There's not a magic bullet recommendation for the right number of plots to understand a given dataset, but visualizing your data is *always* a good idea. Not only does it allow you to quickly convey your findings (even if you have a non-technical audience), it will often reveal trends in your data that escaped you when you were looking only at numbers. It is important to not only create visualizations, but to **interpret your visualizations** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every plot should**:\n",
    "- Have a title\n",
    "- Have axis labels\n",
    "- Have appropriate tick labels\n",
    "- Text is legible in a plot\n",
    "- Plots demonstrate meaningful and valid relationships\n",
    "- Have an interpretation to aid understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of what your plots should look like following the above guidelines. Note that while the content of this example is unrelated, the principles of visualization hold:\n",

    "Here are some prompts to get you started with visualizations. Feel free to add additional visualizations as you see fit:\n",
    "1. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas `.corr()` to visualize correlations between all numeric features.\n",
    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",

    "<br> There is a myth that prestigious colleges, like those in the Ivy League prefer the SAT over the ACT. While many university admissions offices have publicly stated that this is not true, the results shown here also demonstrates that both SAT and ACT scores have similar correlation to college GPA scores. So, both the SAT and ACT do have similar predictive validity, and both can be regarded as similar in predicting academic success in college.\n"

    "Admittedly, standardized tests are far from perfect. They cannot capture students' attitudes, such as being punctual to class and turning in assignments. However, getting rid of them altogether is not beneficial to colleges who aims to determine the academic potential of incoming students. Furthermore, there could be a wide variation in grading standards between high schools. \n",
    "<br> The results here showed that there is a correlation between SAT scores and college GPA scores. Similarly, there is a correlation between ACT scores and college GPA scores. In addition, both SAT and ACT scores are similar in predicting future academic success in students entering college. \n",
    "<br> So, unless there is a better way to predict a college student's success, removing standardised tests such as the SAT and ACT tests will not enable colleges to make better decisions during student admissions.  \n"
