# Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis



## Introduction

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). 

Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance and success. 

Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. 
Furthermore, according to a 2015 analysis by Inside Higher Ed, the lowest average scores for each part of the SAT came from students with less than $20,000 in family income. The highest scores came from those with more than $200,000 in family income.  
Affected by socioeconomic families - Hispanic and African-American students fair worse than Asian-American and White peers.
Test scores do not correlate to success on campus.

Predictive validity is the measure in which test scores predict an outcome criteria (academic success). 

College grade point average(GPA) is calculated by using the number of grade points a student earns in a given period of time/semester/year in college.





# Problem Statement

Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether ACT and SAT have good predictive validity? ACT and SAT scores will be compared with GPA scores by college. 



## Methods

SAT scores are validated by collecting the scores during the examinee's high school and then correlating the scores with their college GPA.

## Results







## Discussion 









### Limitations

Colleges are not forthcoming with their students' GPA scores at graduation. So college GPA scores are not easy data to find or get to perform an accurate analysis.  

Despite this limitation, the general trend 
Gradeinflation [ref] are getting the same numbers that agree with historical studies demonstrate that the results reflect a general trend in grading over time, and thus the GPA scores were accurate measure of 

our numbers stay almost exactly the same with every sampling.  Historical numbers on average percent Aâ€™s in this update are the same as those found in our 2012 paper (which had much more extensive data).  Historical numbers on average GPAs for private schools in the latest update are all about one percent lower than found in previous updates.  The fact that we are getting the same numbers (that agree with historical studies) with every update gives us confidence that our results not only accurately reflect trends in grading over time but also accurately measure average GPAs and average grade distributions for any year for which we have data.



## Conclusion 
Admittedly, standardized tests are far from perfect but getting rid of them altogether is a kind of self-blinding. Till there is a fairer and better way to determine college admission, sidelining standardised tests such as the SAT and ACT tests will not make college admissions fairer.
