0,Coffee,"Hello everyone,

A couple of years I bought a V60, and started experimenting with it, mostly following online recipes. 

I’ve had limited success with it, comparing my results to coffee shops, however it was still better than cheap drip machines

My main issue was brew time, as whatever what I did, the brew time was always way way longer than than what the recipes call for. 

Until I realized that what I have is the Tetsu Kasuya edition, and apparently it has a slower drip than the regular V60. 

Anyone has experience with this specific edition, and maybe some advise in adapting the recipes for it?

I know I need to grind coarser, but by how much? Anything else I need to worry about?

Thanks!",Tetsu Kasuya signature V60,"Hello everyone,

4,Coffee,"I very recently moved into a new country and have been exploring the coffee scene around. I bought a few bags of beans from a place and tested them in a few methods, made a few chemex, v60 and espressos with them but the coffee was really not gassy (little to no crema on espresso, blooming on the pour overs was non existent) and this roastery didn't put the roast date on their bag so I just assumed I got stale coffee. Tried another roastery that does put the roast date and got the same result even though the bag says the coffee was roasted 1-2 weeks ago.

i am a teacher and my new job requires me to wake up even earlier than normal, and the thought of rolling out of bed, grinding coffee, weighing it, bringing water to a boil, and lovingly pouring it evenly over the coffee was just too much.

went to the store and bought a drip machine with an automatic setting so i could prep it the night before.

20,Coffee,"I am brewing my first Yemen coffee, Passenger Haimi.  It is good but boring to me as it smells and tastes exactly like a typical natural processed Ethiopian except instead of blueberry I get lemon taste. 

From everything I have read, and per a reply from the roaster, it should have fudge and nut tastes.  


I have the water matched per Passenger with 50% diluted Third Wave Water - Passenger confirmed diluted 50% is closer to their cupping water that is fairly soft.   I suspect I should go finer, as typical Ethiopian natural profile seems more bright than fudge and nuts, so perhaps higher extraction would move toward those flavors.

36,Coffee,"My father and I use the same moka pot and the same coffee, but different techniques.

My technique is that I preboil the water and preheat the electric range because I heard it made a difference. My coffee is pretty good.

His technique is to put the thing on the electric range from cold.

His moka pot is positively shit, and emits a disgusting rancid burned smell for 30 minutes after being made.

We both stop it at the same moment (as soon as the strong bubbling sound starts) and remove the pot from the heat source.

So I went on a quest to understand the cause of the vexatious smell and taste.

My obvious hypothesis was the ""brewing from cold"" thing, but I tested that and my batches of brewing from cold are *fine*, not nearly as bad as his. 

So my alternate theory was that he fills the chamber with too much water, so a weak coffee solution ends up staying in the chamber after extraction is complete, in contact with the &gt;100c metal chamber, and ends up burning off, giving off that shitty smell. I watched him perform the batch, and confirmed this hypothesis. Then ran a test of overfilled chamber with hot-start, and the results validated the hypothesis.

So my conclusion is: the most important parameter in the moka pot is to respect the instructions and not fill above the valve!","Moka pot: Slight difference in technique, huge difference in result.","My father and I use the same moka pot and the same coffee, but different techniques.

My technique is that I preboil the water and preheat the electric range because I heard it made a difference. My coffee is pretty good.

His technique is to put the thing on the electric range from cold.

His moka pot is positively shit, and emits a disgusting rancid burned smell for 30 minutes after being made.

We both stop it at the same moment (as soon as the strong bubbling sound starts) and remove the pot from the heat source.

So I went on a quest to understand the cause of the vexatious smell and taste.

My obvious hypothesis was the ""brewing from cold"" thing, but I tested that and my batches of brewing from cold are *fine*, not nearly as bad as his.

I originally started writing this as a reply to another post but it turned into a wall of text I felt justified its own post.
****

Having been down the water for coffee rabbit hole last year, I found the cheapest option and my preferred workflow is making my own. On the surface this whole endeavour can seem crazy but it honestly has added a whole new dimension to how I make coffee; providing your have good, fresh beans you can easily tell the difference when your start water was as hard as mine was. For reference, I was starting with a general hardness (GH) of 350ppm and (KH) carbonate hardness of 250ppm.

[Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/LtX3zC6) of a table I made comparing a couple of different methods in terms of price/litre. I ended up purchasing a water distiller for about £50 from eBay and it will have paid for itself after about year compared to buying deionised water at 50p/litre. I'll talk through some of the other options, I try to keep the science to a minimum but feel free to check out the links at the bottom for an introduction to the water chemistry and types of hardness in water.

As a brief overview, *hardness isn't all bad*. You just don't want too much or too little. There are 2 types: GH and KH.

* GH is responsible for the extraction of important flavours from your coffee beans, too much and you'll see classic over extraction, too little and your coffee will lack flavour.
* KH is the 'buffer' or alkalinity of the water. Coffee is acidic, and in speciality we tend to like that acidity particularly associated with light roasts. Too much KH and you'll knock out the acidity of the drink and raise the overall pH, your coffee will taste very flat. Too little KH and your cup will be harsh and overly acidic. This is also useful to know if you're not a fan of acidity, aim for water with a higher KH.

#**Ready-to-Go Solutions**

**Bottled Water**

Most supermarket and even branded bottled water is actually very far from [ideal water for coffee](https://www.home-barista.com/forums/userpix/10510_homeburrerohardnessalkalinitygraph3.png) - ([forum post](https://www.home-barista.com/water/good-references-on-water-treatment-for-coffee-espresso-t41636-10.html#p492153)). For example, [Asda's mineral water](https://groceries.asda.com/product/still-water/asda-still-natural-mineral-water-bottles/910003126202) has pretty decent general hardness (GH) (calcium+magnesium of 54mg/litre), but a buffer (bicarbonate) of 166mg/litre, way off the scale. Still possibly better than home tap water in some areas of the UK, but that high buffer is going to mute a lot of the acidity in your cup. And it's nothing to do with price/quality, [Evian is even worse](https://www.evian.com/en_us/what-is-spring-water/water-attributes/) for example. This is simply because what people find tastes good in water has no bearing on what makes good coffee. The closest you'll get is [Volvic](https://www.volvic.co.uk/products/natural-mineral-water/volvic-natural-mineral-water/natural-mineral-water-500ml) which is a particularly soft water (a little too soft even), but if you don't mind paying the 38p/litre the option is there. Just to add for the environmentally conscious: bear in mind the plastic waste / transport / production costs of buying many bottles of water in this way. Out of all the options I would assume this has the highest environmental impact.
****
**Water filters**

A few different companies to choose from here but essentially they all work by passing the water over an ion exchange resin to swap out calcium and magnesium ions for something else (usually sodium, which we can ignore). On top of this they usually include an active carbon filter to reduce presence of other chemicals that could impart smell/flavour such as chlorine. The filtration effect here effectively reduces the hardness of your starting water, with different brands providing a different offset. I'm not sure if this effect scales with hardness or is a fixed reduction but the harder the water in, the harder it will be coming out. In nearly all cases, these filters are 'dumb' and provide a fixed amount of filtration with the only option being a bypass if you want to increase the hardness of the resulting water. The way the filters reduce GH and carbonate hardness (KH) will differ from brand to brand also, so you'd need to test a few to find one that reduces your tap mineral content in the right proportions.

It's generally recommended you swap these filters out at least every two months for hygiene so you're looking at [about £3.33](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BRITA-MAXTRA-water-filter-cartridge/dp/B071FJ6FBW) every two months, or 5.5p/day. Personally I drink one 300ml cup a day so that works out around 18p/litre, obviously if you drink more coffee this becomes better value. The big caveat I would put on this solution is that these filters degrade, and they do so over time rather than suddenly stop working X number of days in. This means you're constantly fighting the changing mineral content in your water and this becomes a frustrating variable in your process as your work through a new bag of beans, particularly when swapping to a fresh filter.
****
**In-line softeners**

These are essentially water filters on a much larger scale and soften the water to your entire house (or individual tap), in the price screenshot I listed it as 'water2buy' which is just one of many companies selling the smaller kits. Same pros/cons as above but you probably pay less per litre at the cost of having to soften ALL the water this device is connected to, if you're only using it for coffee though the price/litre is probably very high due to the hygiene limitation. Some other positives: Changing the filters out is far less frequent than with a water filter. A large whole-house solution may save you money on repairing pipes/showers due to limescale build-up. Some downside include: You have to install a large system which may not be an option if you rent.  Large systems will often reduce your hardness to 0, meaning you have to re-mineralise. In my case, our system reduced GH from 350ppm to near-0, but left KH completely unaffected at 250ppm, ratio-wise this is much worse than the unfiltered water and made coffee taste extremely flat.
****
**Reverse Osmosis**

Very similar to above but very expensive, and depending on the system you may have to re-mineralise or use a partial bypass anyway. I listed Osmio as a novel on-demand countertop solution (has a following on some home coffee forums), but the upfront cost is around £300-£400 and then you're locked in to using their expensive refills too.

#**DIY Solutions**

**Deionised**

As mentioned above, this costs around 50p/Litre in the UK if you're lucky and can find a supermarket selling the 5L bottles of CarPlan. This is also not ideal from a health perspective as a long-term solution as it is not rated for human consumption, and while possibly fine, CarPlan are not at fault if it turns out there are traces of heavy metals or whatever in the water.
****
**Distilled**

Just a note that distilled/deionised are the same for our purposes, particularly as we're boiling the water to make coffee and are mainly concerned with the primary mineral composition. If you're lucky you might [live near a station](https://www.google.com/search?q=distilled+water+station+uk) that you can purchase distilled water from in large quantities for about 4p/L after VAT. I don't know if this is technically safe to drink or if you need to be a business / buy in ridiculously large volumes to use them though. Otherwise, you can buy an [electric water distiller](https://imgur.com/a/RqnqzpC) and make your own at home. The costs for this earlier in the post of 11p/litre were based on the electricity price at the time of 14p/kWh, right now that's obviously a little low.

With both this and deionised, you then have two options. If your tap water is already in a nice ratio of GH:KH, you can take a little bit of that, do some maths, and top up your distilled water to give you the same ratio of GH:KH but in much lower quantities suitable for making coffee. Note your water's GH is likely primarily calcium and the recipes below use magnesium sulphate, you should take 1ppm of calcium to be equivalent to about 1.6-2ppm of magnesium (though don't quote me on this. This is where a lot of Max Dashwood's research was focused).

The other option is to buy some [sodium bicarbonate](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/baking-essentials-44/sainsburys-bicarbonate-of-soda-180g) and [epsom salts
](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/westlab-pure-mineral-bathing-epsom-salt-1kg) *(make sure it's pure magnesium sulphate!)* and make your own water from scratch. [This Barista Hustle guide](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/diy-water-recipes-redux/) is extremely useful and the process is very simple once you've done it once or twice. Essentially you keep 2 x 1L bottles of distilled water in the fridge with a couple of grams of the above ingredients added (one bottle for each), make your distilled water, weigh it, then add the appropriate amounts of each bottle solution to make your desired 'recipe'. (If you decide you've found the perfect recipe, you could simplify this further to 1 bottle with both ingredients and re-do the maths). I [made a little spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvKNBp_ForKk6iGg4liM11qj4akPMpl-/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114356737394923377433&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true) on my phone to make these calculations painless and the whole process takes me about 5 mins once every 2-3 weeks. 

The upfront costs with this method are: the water distiller (about £50), a set of 0.01g resolution scales (about £15), and the bicarbonate of soda and epsom salts (about £4 total and basically never runs out because you use so little).

I originally started writing this as a reply to another post but it turned into a wall of text I felt justified its own post.
****

Having been down the water for coffee rabbit hole last year, I found the cheapest option and my preferred workflow is making my own. On the surface this whole endeavour can seem crazy but it honestly has added a whole new dimension to how I make coffee; providing your have good, fresh beans you can easily tell the difference when your start water was as hard as mine was. For reference, I was starting with a general hardness (GH) of 350ppm and (KH) carbonate hardness of 250ppm.

[Here's a screenshot](https://imgur.com/LtX3zC6) of a table I made comparing a couple of different methods in terms of price/litre. I ended up purchasing a water distiller for about £50 from eBay and it will have paid for itself after about year compared to buying deionised water at 50p/litre. I'll talk through some of the other options, I try to keep the science to a minimum but feel free to check out the links at the bottom for an introduction to the water chemistry and types of hardness in water.

As a brief overview, *hardness isn't all bad*. You just don't want too much or too little. There are 2 types: GH and KH.

* GH is responsible for the extraction of important flavours from your coffee beans, too much and you'll see classic over extraction, too little and your coffee will lack flavour.
* KH is the 'buffer' or alkalinity of the water. Coffee is acidic, and in speciality we tend to like that acidity particularly associated with light roasts. Too much KH and you'll knock out the acidity of the drink and raise the overall pH, your coffee will taste very flat. Too little KH and your cup will be harsh and overly acidic. This is also useful to know if you're not a fan of acidity, aim for water with a higher KH.

**Bottled Water**

Most supermarket and even branded bottled water is actually very far from [ideal water for coffee](https://www.home-barista.com/forums/userpix/10510_homeburrerohardnessalkalinitygraph3.png) - ([forum post](https://www.home-barista.com/water/good-references-on-water-treatment-for-coffee-espresso-t41636-10.html#p492153)). For example, [Asda's mineral water](https://groceries.asda.com/product/still-water/asda-still-natural-mineral-water-bottles/910003126202) has pretty decent general hardness (GH) (calcium+magnesium of 54mg/litre), but a buffer (bicarbonate) of 166mg/litre, way off the scale. Still possibly better than home tap water in some areas of the UK, but that high buffer is going to mute a lot of the acidity in your cup. And it's nothing to do with price/quality, [Evian is even worse](https://www.evian.com/en_us/what-is-spring-water/water-attributes/) for example. This is simply because what people find tastes good in water has no bearing on what makes good coffee. The closest you'll get is [Volvic](https://www.volvic.co.uk/products/natural-mineral-water/volvic-natural-mineral-water/natural-mineral-water-500ml) which is a particularly soft water (a little too soft even), but if you don't mind paying the 38p/litre the option is there. Just to add for the environmentally conscious: bear in mind the plastic waste / transport / production costs of buying many bottles of water in this way. Out of all the options I would assume this has the highest environmental impact.
****
**Water filters**

A few different companies to choose from here but essentially they all work by passing the water over an ion exchange resin to swap out calcium and magnesium ions for something else (usually sodium, which we can ignore). On top of this they usually include an active carbon filter to reduce presence of other chemicals that could impart smell/flavour such as chlorine. The filtration effect here effectively reduces the hardness of your starting water, with different brands providing a different offset. I'm not sure if this effect scales with hardness or is a fixed reduction but the harder the water in, the harder it will be coming out. In nearly all cases, these filters are 'dumb' and provide a fixed amount of filtration with the only option being a bypass if you want to increase the hardness of the resulting water. The way the filters reduce GH and carbonate hardness (KH) will differ from brand to brand also, so you'd need to test a few to find one that reduces your tap mineral content in the right proportions.

It's generally recommended you swap these filters out at least every two months for hygiene so you're looking at [about £3.33](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BRITA-MAXTRA-water-filter-cartridge/dp/B071FJ6FBW) every two months, or 5.5p/day. Personally I drink one 300ml cup a day so that works out around 18p/litre, obviously if you drink more coffee this becomes better value. The big caveat I would put on this solution is that these filters degrade, and they do so over time rather than suddenly stop working X number of days in. This means you're constantly fighting the changing mineral content in your water and this becomes a frustrating variable in your process as your work through a new bag of beans, particularly when swapping to a fresh filter.
****
**In-line softeners**

These are essentially water filters on a much larger scale and soften the water to your entire house (or individual tap), in the price screenshot I listed it as 'water2buy' which is just one of many companies selling the smaller kits. Same pros/cons as above but you probably pay less per litre at the cost of having to soften ALL the water this device is connected to, if you're only using it for coffee though the price/litre is probably very high due to the hygiene limitation. Some other positives: Changing the filters out is far less frequent than with a water filter. A large whole-house solution may save you money on repairing pipes/showers due to limescale build-up. Some downside include: You have to install a large system which may not be an option if you rent.  Large systems will often reduce your hardness to 0, meaning you have to re-mineralise. In my case, our system reduced GH from 350ppm to near-0, but left KH completely unaffected at 250ppm, ratio-wise this is much worse than the unfiltered water and made coffee taste extremely flat.
****
**Reverse Osmosis**

Very similar to above but very expensive, and depending on the system you may have to re-mineralise or use a partial bypass anyway. I listed Osmio as a novel on-demand countertop solution (has a following on some home coffee forums), but the upfront cost is around £300-£400 and then you're locked in to using their expensive refills too.

#**DIY Solutions**

**Deionised**

As mentioned above, this costs around 50p/Litre in the UK if you're lucky and can find a supermarket selling the 5L bottles of CarPlan. This is also not ideal from a health perspective as a long-term solution as it is not rated for human consumption, and while possibly fine, CarPlan are not at fault if it turns out there are traces of heavy metals or whatever in the water.
****
**Distilled**

Just a note that distilled/deionised are the same for our purposes, particularly as we're boiling the water to make coffee and are mainly concerned with the primary mineral composition. If you're lucky you might [live near a station](https://www.google.com/search?q=distilled+water+station+uk) that you can purchase distilled water from in large quantities for about 4p/L after VAT. I don't know if this is technically safe to drink or if you need to be a business / buy in ridiculously large volumes to use them though. Otherwise, you can buy an [electric water distiller](https://imgur.com/a/RqnqzpC) and make your own at home. The costs for this earlier in the post of 11p/litre were based on the electricity price at the time of 14p/kWh, right now that's obviously a little low.

With both this and deionised, you then have two options. If your tap water is already in a nice ratio of GH:KH, you can take a little bit of that, do some maths, and top up your distilled water to give you the same ratio of GH:KH but in much lower quantities suitable for making coffee. Note your water's GH is likely primarily calcium and the recipes below use magnesium sulphate, you should take 1ppm of calcium to be equivalent to about 1.6-2ppm of magnesium (though don't quote me on this. This is where a lot of Max Dashwood's research was focused).

The other option is to buy some [sodium bicarbonate](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/baking-essentials-44/sainsburys-bicarbonate-of-soda-180g) and [epsom salts
](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/westlab-pure-mineral-bathing-epsom-salt-1kg) *(make sure it's pure magnesium sulphate!)* and make your own water from scratch. [This Barista Hustle guide](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/diy-water-recipes-redux/) is extremely useful and the process is very simple once you've done it once or twice. Essentially you keep 2 x 1L bottles of distilled water in the fridge with a couple of grams of the above ingredients added (one bottle for each), make your distilled water, weigh it, then add the appropriate amounts of each bottle solution to make your desired 'recipe'. (If you decide you've found the perfect recipe, you could simplify this further to 1 bottle with both ingredients and re-do the maths). I [made a little spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvKNBp_ForKk6iGg4liM11qj4akPMpl-/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114356737394923377433&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true) on my phone to make these calculations painless and the whole process takes me about 5 mins once every 2-3 weeks. 

The upfront costs with this method are: the water distiller (about £50), a set of 0.01g resolution scales (about £15), and the bicarbonate of soda and epsom salts (about £4 total and basically never runs out because you use so little).

164,Coffee,"My coffee addiction started when I began working at Tim Hortons in high school. I want to try more types, but I think I don’t like acidic/fruity/tomato-y coffees or when they are very bitter and thick.

I’ve been ordering Americanos a lot because I’m so picky with drip coffee, as most americanos are really good to me (I drink my coffee black). 



Here are all the coffees I’ve tried that I can think of:

I do like Tim Hortons coffee. Meh towards their dark roast.

I love most breakfast blends I’ve tried. 
I love the Trader Joe’s Breakfast Blend.
I love the Original Pancake House’s coffee.

Hard no at Starbucks Pike Place.
I like Starbucks Veranda Blend. 

I don’t love Dunkin, but I can drink it. 
I prefer McDonalds coffee to Dunkin (if it’s fresh), but it’s still not my fav.
Panera would rank above dunkin and McDonald’s for me (regular and hazelnut) but below all the other ones I like. 

I love Seattle’s Best House Blend
I despised either the Seattle’s Best Post Alley or Portside roast—whichever one is near black and smells pungent and burnt.

I also had a really strong Colombian coffee once from the farmers market and it was too bitter and thick for me (could have just been that brand through)

2. Other flavors are no longer interest to me. Most noticeably, beer. Or at least, bitter beer.

Found a good grinder, bought some brew devices, and took a serious stab at finding what kind of coffee I truly like. From that experiment, I’ve learned 2 things:

1. I don’t think I’ve ever had a decent cup of coffee (edit, I come from a family of creamer and sugar stock. Never really tasted the coffee so much as the hazelnut flavor).

2. Other flavors are no longer interest to me. Most noticeably, beer. Or at least, bitter beer.

I want a super automatic. I’m not REALLY into espresso, I’m still new to it but I appreciate the craft and I may eventually go the manual route. I’m not interested in hearing about how much better the semis are, I get it.

We aren’t extremely picky but I’d like a reliable machine that performs well. Maybe as an introduction to a hobby. (Consider us extreme neophytes). 

Price point: we are willing to spend some money on something that will last. Budget is in the 3-5k range.

Jura (S8 seems to be popular)
DeLonghi (6700?)

225,Coffee,"After staying away from coffee for a month, I decided to relapse and start drinking coffee again. The main reasons I initially stayed away from coffee were:

1. I read articles about it being bad for the brain's learning processes.
2. It made me feel like I had to poop right away.
3. It made me sweat.
4. It ruined my sleep.
5. Low-cal coffee (milkless, sugarless coffee) didn't taste very good.

(I have since learned that 1. isn't entirely true, 2. can be fixed by opting for darker roast (and therefore  lower acid levels) coffee, 3. was something I just had to live with, 4. could be fixed if I moderated my caffeine intake from other sources. 

After doing some research on how to fix 5., I found that the coffee from a French press was said to be very good and decided to experiment with one. I tend to prefer coffees that aren't too bitter, and aren't too watery. The sweetness I could fix by throwing in some artificial sweetener.

What I need to know is: 

1. Which French Press would be best for me? Bodum Chambord 3 cup is what I'm looking at right now, price and value wise.
2. Which course ground coffee should I get (so that 2. and 5.  wouldn't be an issue)?

So far I've tried between 8 and 20 hours and I've settled on around 8 being the time at which the brew begins to become bitter. The difference in bitterness between 8 and 10 hours is staggering. The problem is, at no point before this is the brew tasty or flavorful, it just seems empty and bland. I've tried a lot of cold brew from many different cafes and what I'm making isn't even half as good as theirs. 

My current thoughts are:
Grinding coarser - this seems to just extend the time I need to brew for but the flavor ends up being the same. Maybe I need to go a lot coarser instead of slightly coarser, but from what I've read, others recommending the 22-26 range seems common.
Grinding finer - too many fine particles end up slipping through and making the brew unpleasant to drink.

Don't own a coffee pot. I've never ~brewed coffee before outside of the normal office break room drip brew or sticking a pod in a keurig. I did use an old roommate's French press for a year. As a pretty low caffeine person i usually go for green tea, but ive been craving coffee again, I love lattes, cappucino, etc. Not a fan of too much sweetness usually but just creamy coffee. I do appreciate it black now and again, esp with cold brew. Usually drink store bought or get it from a shop.

I usually only have one cup in the morning, a few times a week.. maybe one in the afternoon. so the ability to brew a large volume doesn't matter to me. What Does matter to me is relative simplicity. I do have a kitchen scale. I have a water kettle that boils but no temp indicator. 
Ease of cleaning. 
Do I need to buy filters? 
How long does it take?
How involved is the method?

As a complete novice who just wants a warm drink that doesn't taste horrible which of these three brew apparati which would you pull the trigger on? Based on what I can pick up at target today.

-Aeropress (kind of intimidated by this, don't understand it, not sure how it differs from a French press, but it seems popular so there must be a reason)
-Bodum pour over (8 cup) (is a Stainless steel filter good?) (Appeals aesthetically)
-Moka pot (3 cup) 

Or a French press (is this coffee too fine-ground?)

Or just a basic / normal coffee maker?

This isn't available at my target but I've been watching James Hoffman videos and the hario v60 looks cool... 

So many options!

I usually just heat up some plant (almond/oat/hemp) milk and put a splash into my coffee, sometimes up to half. Cafe con leche is my jam. Maybe a little cinnamon if I'm feeling crazy.

Any tips or advice is much appreciated! Cheers!",Noob Café Bustelo,"I meant to get instant, but I ended up getting two cans of vacuum sealed ground bustelo decaf cos they were a BOGO deal.

273,Coffee,"(Warning: this will be a fairly long post; I have a lot of questions. There will be a tl;dr at the end that will probably be comprehensive enough for most people to give their recommendations accurately.)

I’m pretty new to brewing my own coffee, but I think I’ve tried enough to know my preferences when it comes to coffee characteristics. Currently, I just buy beans from a grocery store, grind them, and brew my coffee with a French press, but I would like to have full control of brewing, and I need recommendations based on my tastes.

I’ll organize my post into four categories that correspond to the order of the brewing process.

1. Beans.
I drink my coffee black. I prefer a full-body (oily) coffee with a nutty flavor, and while I don’t like sweet coffee, some fruity flavors are still okay. I like my coffee strong, but not overwhelmingly acidic; silty coffee is typically a no-go. Ethically-sourced beans are a must, and just for the sake of convenience, I need beans that can be bought in smaller quantities (since a lot of ethically-sourced coffee I’ve seen can only be bought in bulk.) It’s important to note that I’m a college student, so I can’t afford to frequently purchase especially expensive coffee beans.

2. Roasting (If Necessary.)
Admittedly, I don’t know how much of a difference it makes to roast your own beans. If it’s necessary, what process/product(s)do you recommend for roasting? Again, I prefer a medium roast.

3. Grinding.
This one is mostly asking for a product recommendation, since I’m currently using a fairly cheap grinder that I received as a gift. Answers will probably conditional, since the appropriate grinder and coarseness will largely depend on my brewing method, but I’m listing this category since I’d still like to get recommendations.

4. Brewing.
Again, I like a strong, oily, full-body coffee, however I don’t want the texture to get to the point of being syrupy. I’m using a cheap French press at the moment, but I’m not sure if I’d like to upgrade to a nicer one, or switch to a different brewing method altogether. In particular, I’m interested in americano and long black, as well as Turkish coffee. The problem with French press is that I feel my coffee isn’t quite as oily as I’d like, but that could be due to factors unrelated to French press in general, such as the beans, the quality of my grinder and the coarseness of the grounds, the quality of my particular French press, and the way that I personally brew my coffee. I also have concerns with the other methods: long black and americano are brews that I’m not too familiar with, aside from a handful of times that I’ve bought a cup at a coffee shop, as well as descriptions I’ve read online. I’m not entirely sure what the texture of a good long black or americano is, other than that they’re usually described as being full or oily. My concern is that the texture may either be even less oily than the French press, or potentially have the opposite problem and become syrupy. I have unfortunately never actually tried Turkish coffee, but every description of it that I’ve heard or read aligns fairly well with my tastes. My primary concern with Turkish coffee is that it may be too acidic or even sour because it’s typically finely ground. I can only afford to purchase one of the three between espresso machine, Turkish coffee pot, and new French press at the moment, so buying them all and experimenting sadly isn’t an option.

tl;dr: I need recommendations based on my tastes in the following categories: beans, roasting products/methods (possibly), coffee grinders and grinding methods, and products for brewing coffee (specifically French press, Turkish coffee pot, and espresso machine), as well as information on the proper process for brewing with these methods.

Likes: full/oily (buttery) texture, medium roast, moderately strong/bitter acidity, nutty flavor.

Dislikes: watery texture, overly oily (syrupy) texture, overwhelmingly acidic (sour) taste, sweet flavor, any additives such as milk, creamer, and sugar.

Ethically-sourced is a must, silt is a no-go.

Please keep in mind that I’m on a budget and can’t completely splurge, especially for something I’d have to buy frequently, like beans. Thanks in advance for any recommendations, and I hope I can learn more about coffee and maybe expand my taste in the future!

282,Coffee,"As a newcomer to coffee enthusiasm, I am still discovering new things every day. For example, today I discovered the Phin Vietnamese coffee maker, while searching for information on something completely different. And that got me thinking.

I was actually looking for information on the Durobor monofilter. This is a metal drip filter for a single cup of coffee that was in use in Belgium until the 1980s (and probably also in France, but Durobor is a Belgian manufacturer which continued to produce glassware until 2019, but then went bankrupt). If you went to a café and you asked for a coffee, you almost always got such a filter. As a child, I never knew anything else. Later, those metal filters were replaced by plastic ones with the ground coffee already in it (vacuum-packed per 10 pieces). As you would expect, the quality is not at all comparable.

A photo of the Durobor monofilter can be found here (this was before I had cleaned it, so you can see what excellent condition it was still in). I was able to buy this one at the flea market in Brussels a week ago for only € 5.00 ($ 5.86 or £ 4.27). I had to walk around for almost two hours before I could find such a pristine specimen. This one is in stainless steel. There are also silver-plated models, though usually in much worse condition.

But now you must admit ... this is very similar to the Vietnamese coffee maker in terms of both design and method, isn't it?

Coffee was introduced to Vietnam by the French in 1857. But after the Vietnam War (1955-1975), coffee production was limited due to governmental restraints which limited private enterprise. It wasn’t until 1987 that privately owned enterprises were permitted again. Nowadays about 97% of Vietnam’s coffee comes from Robusta.

So I think the Vietnamese took the Belgian-French model of the monofilter and adapted it to become the so-called Phin. But is there any proof of that? Because, of course, it also could have been the other way around. What strikes me in any case is that you find a lot of information about the Phin, but almost nothing about the Durobor monofilter, which has been almost completely forgotten.

For example, today I discovered the Phin Vietnamese coffee maker, while searching for information on something completely different. And that got me thinking.

I was actually looking for information on the Durobor monofilter. This is a metal drip filter for a single cup of coffee that was in use in Belgium until the 1980s (and probably also in France, but Durobor is a Belgian manufacturer which continued to produce glassware until 2019, but then went bankrupt). If you went to a café and you asked for a coffee, you almost always got such a filter. As a child, I never knew anything else. Later, those metal filters were replaced by plastic ones with the ground coffee already in it (vacuum-packed per 10 pieces). As you would expect, the quality is not at all comparable.

A photo of the Durobor monofilter can be found here (this was before I had cleaned it, so you can see what excellent condition it was still in). I was able to buy this one at the flea market in Brussels a week ago for only € 5.00 ($ 5.86 or £ 4.27). I had to walk around for almost two hours before I could find such a pristine specimen. This one is in stainless steel. There are also silver-plated models, though usually in much worse condition.

But now you must admit ... this is very similar to the Vietnamese coffee maker in terms of both design and method, isn't it?

Coffee was introduced to Vietnam by the French in 1857. But after the Vietnam War (1955-1975), coffee production was limited due to governmental restraints which limited private enterprise. It wasn’t until 1987 that privately owned enterprises were permitted again. Nowadays about 97% of Vietnam’s coffee comes from Robusta.

So I think the Vietnamese took the Belgian-French model of the monofilter and adapted it to become the so-called Phin. But is there any proof of that? Because, of course, it also could have been the other way around. What strikes me in any case is that you find a lot of information about the Phin, but almost nothing about the Durobor monofilter, which has been almost completely forgotten.

338,Coffee,"I would like to see if there's any data to compare the actual grind results of various grinders. 

I have an Encore grinder and have been sifting out fines with good results. I'm probably losing about 8% of my coffee doing this. I think 2% or so gets stuck in the machine. It would be cool to cut out the sifting step and have more coffee per bag, but how much better can the grind quality get?

I'm buying $20 bags, so at 8% loss per bag that's $1.60. The effort to sift out the fines is pretty minimal so that's not that big of an issue.

Does a $300-$500 grinder solve this problem or is it just about features/reliabilty? 

Has anyone tested various grinders using several levels of filtration to determine what the grind size variability is for each? 

We all know that changing grind size has a major effect on flavor. Every time you grind there are many different sized grinds in the mix. Different grinders are going to have a different distribution of grind sizes. Maybe you get less fines, but more pieces that are somewhat in the middle of the range with a certain grinder. Maybe certain beans crush differently and break into tiny fragments easy regardless of the grinder used. Darker roasts are probably grinding slightly different than lighter roasts.

It seems like since there can be so many variables to determine the consistency of grind size, then it would be prudent to filter them regardless of how good the grinder is. 

Perhaps grinding 3 different sizes and blending those grinds would be better than using a single grind size. 

If it's such an important variable why aren't people getting into these details more?

The place seemed to have workflow issues they were trying their best to cope with. It is a hole in the wall type place. No seating just a counter onto a public walkway. So they had three people.

I was running out of time to wait so I went up to tell them I'll just take a refund. Anyway the strange practice was they had 6 milk jugs on the counter already presumably frothed with milk. So when I asked for a refund they just put the next shot in my cup and poured the milk already waiting.

I guess the idea is that they swap between frothing and pulling shots. Is this the most efficient way? I feel there would be time saved by doing the typical way where you are frothing while pulling shots. I'd imagine typically you would pull the max shots on your machine to how many groups you have (presuming it is a machine that automatically stops), go back to frothing the largest pitcher you have while the shots are all pulled.

Weak La Nina events, coupled with Brazil deforestation can result in disasters to Brazil coffee crops (like last year), but strong La Ninas actually affect crops further south in South America like corn and soybeans and do not directly correlate to droughts for Brazil coffee. It is also important to monitor something we call the Tropical South Atlantic (TSA) Index--ocean temperatures along the equator and near west Africa in the Atlantic. A positive (warm) TSA could help feed the jetstream and bring rains to drought areas, while a negative TSA (cool) can exacerbate droughts.

There is even a phenomenon called a La Nina Modoki; a west-based La Nina. Confused? Yes, I can understand, but the bottom line is that La Nina and El Nino only give meteorologists an ""a ruff starting point"" to make long-range weather forecast predictions; nothing is written in stone due to a warming climate and chaos theory.

Strong La Nina events can lower Central America or Colombia coffee crops due to too much rain and flooding (IE 2010-2012 La Nina). El Nino can lower both Vietnam and northern Brazil coffee production with hot dry weather (IE 2014-2015)--both major spikes in both Robusta and Arabica coffee prices.

 so my idea would be that when you add the water to a mocha pot you mix in cinnamon or some other spices before boiling.

 can this work? will this fuck up my mocha pot? has this been done before

My dad tried a bunch of my coffee when I did a thing at Christmas a couple years ago. He gravitated to the George Howell (the Boston pride probably added to the appeal), so I started sending him a bag or two every few months, and about 6 months ago I got him a nice grinder to start sending whole bean. He appreciates the pricier bags, but he won't buy $20-50 bags regularly like I do. He tried picking out some cheaper beans on his own from the store but sent me a vomit emoji with the picture, and now today he just got the GH I sent and said ""the grinder could use the work"". I want him to be able to use it beyond the bags I send.

Since everything I buy is beyond what he is willing to, I'm trying to find him some good beans to buy regularly. Any gems in the $8-10 (hard limit) a bag price range with minimum spend free shipping? He'll order a few bags at a time or do a subscription if he can pick them each time and it's cheap enough.",Good cheap beans.,"

First contender is the Bambino Plus.
What I like about this is the conservative size, amateur friendly, the option of automated frothing, and the rapid speed in which it is ready to rumble coming in at just 3 seconds. Being a Mum of 2 rambunctious boys, I need my caffeine fix and I need it fast!

I’ll address the elephant in the room now, the middle man in this love story. The best selling Barista Express. I’ve noticed this machine began so many on their espresso journey. It is highly regarded but at the same time heavily criticized. Many have a huge issue with the grinder, it seems to have poor options when it comes to dialing in the perfect grind. Another con I have found is the slow warm up time compared to newer machines. I guess I could make it work, but my lifestyle would be better suited for something a bit faster. I do enjoy how it has a gauge, it seems to be very helpful for newbies to decide how well the shot is being pulled. My biggest issue is the grinder, it seems to be a big deal when it comes to getting a good shot.

The latter is the barista pro express. It seems to be the best of the two other options in one. It’s got the fast heating on the bambino, it’s got the same grinder of the express but improved with extra clicks to get a better dial in the best grind. It doesn’t have the automated self frothing which is too bad but I guess I can’t miss something I never had. I do like the idea of having the whole setup in one machine. But the bambino is tempting because of its small print.

Some things to consider:
I do not already own a grinder capable of grinding fine enough for espresso. 

If I do get the bambino I would most likely pair it with the 1zpresso JX-pro manual grinder. Which kind of pains me to do because it’s nearly $200 and it’s a manual, ideally I’d get an automatic grinder and I could try to push the budget for one but at that rate it’s driving the cost up to the Barista Pro Express!

I also only use Costco Espresso Beans (as of now) I’m going from a Ninja coffee maker so this whole process will have a huge learning curve but I’ve already learned a lot just comparing all these machines and various grinders. 

My specific questions are:
What are some of the base line automated grinders that will get my by with the portafilter it comes with? From my understanding that portafilter is beginner friendly and can still pull a decent shot with a not so great grinder.

We usually use a pretty finely ground coffee, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference if the grind is coarser. It looks like the rubber stopper thing (excuse my lack of coffee maker part knowledge!) sits flush, and we don’t have a problem with leaking at all.

422,Coffee,"Looking for a espresso repair shop in Maryland, DC is fine too. Don’t really see too much online so I wanted to check to see if anyone has had any good experience with any?

I tried Perfect Brew Services earlier in the year when my Appartamento stopped reaching pressure and needed some replacement parts. But in took one and a half months to get my machine back from them, they cleaned the wrong machine when I picked it up so it was super dirty, charged $200 more when I got there than I was quoted for, and on top of it my machine died (as in doesn’t do anything other than light up when turned on now) two weeks after picking it up from them.

I’m sure I could have taken it back there and had them attempt to fix it again for free but I don’t trust them at all.

430,Coffee,"Been using this machine for several months now, with a few different types of beans and a few different settings (ie grind, amount, tamp pressure, basket, etc). My family picked up and moved from Indiana to Florida, and after only a few days here, the pressure won't even pass 1 or 2, let alone into the ""espresso range"". Shots are bitter and watery, with no creama.

We've run a cleaning cycle and done descaling as instructed and with the supplies provided. We've adjusted grind size and amount and tried different beans. I even used filtered water instead of tap to see if that was an issue. The Q&amp;A in the manual isn't bringing results. We usually grind on size 2 or 3, so should we be trying something higher, like 5 or 6?

It should be noted that running a blind shot (with the rubber cleaning disk and no grounds) comes up with very high pressure, so it doesn't seem to be a machine defect.

If anyone has some advice I could try, it'd be greatly appreciated! I'm not sure if perhaps the beans are stale, if the water in Florida is somehow different, or if it's something with the grind size or amount. Any thoughts are welcome!

463,Coffee,"Hi, I actually don't drink coffee, but I'm trying to get a special present for my wife. I think the Technivorm Moccamaster with the metal carafe and no auto stop is the one to get, but I have a few questions.


One of the reasons why my wife doesn't use the machine she has is because there are like 10 different parts to wash every time she uses it that has tiny nooks and crannies. With this, there's the basket, it's lid, the carafe, and the lid of the carafe, which is already a huge improvement. I wanted to know if you're able to run this coffee maker without the carafe lid since it has that long straw thing on it which looks like a chore to wash (we don't have a dish washer). 


Another thing I saw others discussing was to use melitta #4 filters instead of the Technivorm ones. Is there a big difference or should I just let her pick whatever filter she wants to use?


The Moccamaster seems to check the boxes of build quality, good quality coffee, and ease of cleaning. I haven't seen any other coffee makers as ubiquitous as this one. Are there others that I should consider around the same price (or cheaper)?


It seems like coffee grinders are about as preferential as coffee makers. Is there a shortlist that has some universally enjoyed options? I think electric would be preferred over hand.

My girlfriend is a busy woman and avid coffee drinker. I am not a coffee drinker, so need some outside help to get her a good maker. We had a pretty old model of a Keurig 2.0 that she used for quite a while, but she has been using grounds instead of K-cups for the last couple years, so that machine was not very friendly to her (had to use basically a special cup filled with grounds and the Keurig was very xenophobic to non-K-cups). She began actively looking for a replacement not long ago.

She received a new Cuisinart coffee maker as a gift, but it hasn't been the right fit for her. It's a kind that only makes a huge pot of coffee, and as someone who drinks just about 16 oz. or so everyday and no more, all of the upkeep that goes along with that size of maker isn't worth it. It's also too big for our counter!

So I'm looking to reddit to maybe help me find her a perfect new maker that won't be stressful for her! Ideally I'm looking for a maker that:  
- Makes single-serve, 8 oz. or 12 or 14 or 16 or whatever (or at least, has the option for this amount instead of making a full pot)  
- Grounds-friendly (i.e., not only K-cups)  
- Easy-ish to clean! She doesn't like having to spend so much time cleaning a big pot or the custom cup we had to use for the Keurig.  
- Hopefully, programmable to have a cup ready in the morning! That's one feature she likes about our new one, but I worry it's only found on makers that brew only pots.

538,Coffee,"Hi guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been using Nespresso Pods for awhile now, and have been fiddling with the idea of getting a setup for proper espresso from the kitchen. I'm hoping to look for something that can be done within about 5 minutes. With the budget that I have in mind though, manual espresso makers are also within my scope of consideration. These espresso makers will eventually be my daily drivers, and I'll probably get rid of the Nespresso once I've finished my pods.

&amp;#x200B;

My current choices are:

1. Flair Signature Espresso Maker (New, $256USD)+ 1Zpresso JX (New, $135 USD) = $391 USD

Thoughts: Comes with unpressurized basket out of the box, appears to make decent to great tasting espresso from what I gather. Fully manual with learning curve. Has multiple components to setup before brewing. Multiple components to clean after brew.

2. Delonghi Dedica (New, $317 USD) + 1Zpresso JX (New, $135 USD) = $452 USD

Thoughts: The Dedica will probably be a placeholder until I decide to further upgrade. Will have to look for an unpressurized basket that fits the portafilter. Lesser to clean up, seems easier to operate and clean. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1. Is the Flair extremely finicky to operate and clean after each brew, considering the need for preheating the brew head? I'd like to get from nothing to a cuppa in about 5 minutes or less.
2. Will I be giving up much in the way of quality in the cup if I go for the 2nd combo, even with a 3rd party unpressurized basket?
3. Is it odd to pair a manual grinder with a semi-auto machine? I am considering the fact that a decent enough grinder will probably cost as much, if not more than the espresso machine itself?
4. Does the amount of time put into brewing with the Flair translate to way better quality than in combo #2?

&amp;#x200B;

In my country, the coffee industry isn't that big, and unlike in the US, second hand Gaggia Classics or any other machines that are typically recommended for a first time machine, are non-existent. Also, the people here have no concept of depreciation, with the usual asking price about 80% of RRP. The most common are appliances like the Delonghi Dedicas. I'm open to other suggestions as well.

  I just got my aeropress a few days ago, and I got it because I keep hearing people talk about how easy and consistently good the coffee made with it is. I got the French press partly because I could one day take on another challenge when I was better with the aeropress, but mainly because I can use it to foam milk (I really like coffee milk drinks).

It begins with a call down to reception, jingle and a ring, and proceed to let the guy know I would like to order my first Flat White in 3 years. The world has flat whites, or so it thinks. Now for all coffee connoisseurs out there, you know, Aussies and flat whites are like, Americans and doughnuts, Brits and Bangers, Japanese and Katsu. 

I ask for his honest opinion on the run of the mill hotel coffee, in Australia you can be pleasantly surprised so don’t knock it, ‘I like it but I’m no connoisseur’ his reply (probably not an Aussie). However, he suggests I call across the road as they have ‘bangin’ coffee (maybe he is Aussie after all).

He transfers me across the road, and wishes me luck in my quest, easy!

Coffee Culture lady answers very timidly, I mean who calls a coffee shop? I say, in my overly cheerful way, ‘I want to order my first Aussie flat white in 3 years’…silence ensues… ‘okay she chirps’. Then we get into a conversation about coffee and how important this coffee will be and how great it is etc, connoisseurs chatting away. Oh, how we laughed.

Then we get to contact and payment, I am still without an Australian sim card because hotel life you know, no number, ‘No worries’ she says. I offer to pay with an Aussie credit card I haven’t used in 5 years in Aus and have no idea if it works, of course not mentioning this to her, ‘can’t remember how to take payment anyway’ ‘No worries’ she says. I let her know it will need to be delivered into a hotel full of possibly disease ridden inter-dimensional beings (we came through Singapore and that is further then across any land border in Aus) and into COVID-style, convict status, accommodations, but without any req time, hazmat suit required ‘No worries’ she says. 

We agree that I will just pay at some point in the future upon the successful release of my soul from my cosy little comforter home. I say ‘Cheers’, ‘No worr…Cheers’ she says and we end the call.

7 minutes or so later, I get the knock on the door I had been waiting for. For anyone who has had their door knocked on in a hotel, you understand the terror, relief and joy of it. It is loud and piercing, you think the walls will explode with small door knocking type paraphernalia everywhere. Tap, knock, bang!

I put my mask on, dem da rulz, open my door, and there she is on the floor, coffee spilling out of the plane black spout, no sign of froth, the plane white cup seemingly planner then any I remember. My name scrawled on the side, room 112, in red ink, as to avoid the confusion with other rooms desperate for a caffeine fix at… 1.58pm on a Tuesday, obvious café rush-hour. I grab her greedily and yell thank you down and empty corridor, staff always run scared, and hurry back in. I tear off my mask, there is no hesitation as I slurp the dribbles off the lid, before tentatively sipping to gauge heat not just taste. Heat, perfectly pleasant, but the flavour…nothing… then WHABAM! That’s coffee man. That’s a freaking coffee!

Now I sit here taking up precious time when I should be working or studying and telling myself ‘I’ll do it later’, and, ‘I’ve done heaps today’ (bullshit), ‘I just needed a coffee’, well… it’s here… it’s finally here…. what’s your excuse now Hemingway (proof reading obviously)!

Not going to lie, my excitement and pure childish giddiness that I am renowned for among friends and family may be tarnishing my ability to truly judge how good or bad this coffee is. But you know what, in ordering this coffee, I spoke to Aussies who get it, who went out of there way to get it to me and let no peril get in the way. Connoisseurs, no but they are. Payment? We scoff at this nonsensical thing in Aus, as if that would prevent an Aussie getting their flattest of whites. Hazmat, easy, but it’ll spill.

Aussie’s love their coffee! When anyone ever asks what the coffee culture is like in Aus, let them read this and know, it isn’t just how it tastes but how we treat it and those who love the black liquid of legend.

Wonder if they do Espresso Martini’s?

I'm using a EQ900 coffee maker. The problem is the foam is made with steam and therefor water is mixed in the foam.

--My V60 brewing time is high even with japanese papers, I suspect İt's because of the slight damage on lower portion of the Wilfa's burrs that cause more fines. I expect excellent taste on V60 with JX pro

--I would like to be able to brew with moka pot and aeropress and other different devices, except an espresso machine which I don't see myself buying in future

-- Price, here I can buy a JX Pro for almost half the price of Comandante C40

I’ve been very happy with it but it’s started behaving weirdly lately. Initially the coffee started to get really watery and weak so I replaced the filter and rubber seal (Bialetti parts designed for the venus) and this solved the weak coffee problem.

Now however it’s started to just push a lot of air and very little coffee up through the internal spout. I do get a drinkable cup but usually after a good 5-6 minutes of spluttering. I’ve also replaced the filter funnel (again, Bialetti) but this hasn’t solved the problem.

No water/steam escaping from around the join or from the valve.

Weirdly it occasionally behaves normally but I just cannot pin down anything that I’m doing differently. I haven’t changed anything about my coffee making routine (same amount of water (boiled), same amount of coffee, same type/grind of coffee etc).

602,Coffee,"This has probably been discussed a millions times, but here we go again.

I was under the impression, like most people, that once the coffee is brewed, you just rinse the moka pot under hot water, and maybe use something non-abrasive such as a paper towel, WITHOUT SOAP, to clean the moka pot. This is to stop/reduce the amount of aluminum leeched into the coffee which 1) helps to keep the coffee from tasting metallic and 2) you won't be drinking trace metals.

But then I ran to the coffee expert James Hoffmann who said this is nonsense, that the coffee oils become rancid and add to the bitterness.

619,Coffee,"About a year ago I had a stainless steel vacuum insulated cup that I got at Walmart. I used to make coffee and pour it into that cup. I'd drink coffee every day and drink it in that cup. Over a period of time I started to get a REALLY strange reaction. Coffee would start to have this really strange metallic like taste to it. That taste would linger in my mouth for DAYS. I could stop drinking coffee and I could still taste that weird taste in my mouth even after drinking water brushing my teeth etc.

Eventually I associated that phenomena with the stainless steel mug that I had. So I stopped using that mug entirely. Once I stopped using that mug I stopped getting that flavor/taste or phenomena ever again. 

Fast forward to today. I bought stainless steel straws on Amazon because I was reading how it could be good to use a straw to drink coffee so that the coffee doesn't coat your teeth (acidity, discoloring your teeth, etc). I've used the straw now about 15 times on coffee, then suddenly today I poured my freshly brewed coffee into my coffee mug (non stainless steel) and when I took a sip from my stainless steel straw.... I'm starting to taste the SAME EXACT flavor/taste as when I used that stainless steel mug. It's a really unique taste and I know it instantly. This can't be a coincidence. Is this a phenomena that happens over time with coffee and stainless steel? It HAS to be leaching some sort of metal into the coffee.

625,Coffee,"Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht (Be quiet, do not chat), BWV 211 (1734), also known as the ‘Coffee Cantata’, is a secular cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Although classified as a cantata, it is essentially a miniature comic opera. In a satirical commentary, the cantata amusingly tells of an addiction to coffee. 

Although coffee was already known in Europe, it was not until the end of the 17th century that the drink was introduced on a large scale in Europe after a victory over the Turks. Despite its popularity, coffee was considered by many to be dangerous, especially for the young. Nevertheless, coffee houses were set up in many towns, including in Leipzig, where Bach lived. Music was often played in these coffee houses, and this music even acquired its own name: coffee house music. Bach was a loyal visitor of coffee house Zimmerman in Leipzig for around 20 years. The premiere of the Coffee Cantata also took place in this coffee house.

The cantata is about a man, Herr Schlendrian (Mr. Sloth), who complains that his daughter Lieschen is addicted to coffee.

&gt;*Herr Vater, seid doch nicht so scharf!*  
*Wenn ich des Tages nicht dreimal*  
*Mein Schälchen Coffee trinken darf,*  
*So werd ich ja zu meiner Qual*  
*Wie ein verdorrtes Ziegenbrätchen.*

\[Father sir, but do not be so harsh! / If I couldn't, three times a day, / be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee, / in my anguish I will turn into / a shriveled-up roast goat.\]

Whatever Herr Schlendrian tries, he cannot get his daughter to give up coffee. It is only when the daughter is promised a husband in return for promising not to drink any more coffee that she agrees.

&gt;*Heute noch,*  
*Lieber Vater, tut es doch!*  
*Ach, ein Mann!*  
*Wahrlich, dieser steht mir an!*  
*Wenn es sich doch balde fügte,*  
*Dass ich endlich vor Coffee,*  
*Eh ich noch zu Bette geh,*  
*Einen wackern Liebsten kriegte!*

\[Even today, / dear father, make it happen! / Ah, a husband! / Indeed, this will suit me well! / If it would only happen soon, / that at last, instead of coffee, / before I even go to bed, / I might gain a sturdy lover!\]

But in the marriage contract, she has a clause included that allows her to drink as much coffee as she wants.

&gt;*Kein Freier komm mir in das Haus,*  
*Er hab es mir denn selbst versprochen*  
*Und rück es auch der Ehestiftung ein,*  
*Dass mir erlaubet möge sein,*  
*Den Coffee, wenn ich will, zu kochen.*

\[No suitor comes in my house / unless he has promised to me himself / and has it also inserted into the marriage contract, / that I shall be permitted / to brew coffee whenever I want.\]

Bach wrote no operas. The cantata was written for concert performance, but is today frequently performed fully staged with costumes.

Here we hear and see a particularly entertaining performance by the Netherlands Bach Society, performed live on 17 May 2019 for the All of Bach project. Directed by Marc Pantus, musical director Shunske Sato, starring soprano Lucie Chartin, tenor Jan-Willem Schaafsma and baritone Mattijs van de Woerd.

629,Coffee,"Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht, BWV 211, also known as the 'Coffee Cantata', is a secular cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Although classified as a cantata, it is essentially a miniature comic opera. In a satirical commentary, the cantata amusingly tells of an addiction to coffee.

The cantata is about a man, Herr Schlendrian (Mr. Sloth), who complains that his daughter Lieschen is addicted to coffee.

&gt;Herr Vater, seid doch nicht so scharf!  
Wenn ich des Tages nicht dreimal  
Mein Schälchen Coffee trinken darf,  
So werd ich ja zu meiner Qual  
Wie ein verdorrtes Ziegenbrätchen.

Whatever Herr Schlendrian tries, he cannot get his daughter to give up coffee. It is only when the daughter is promised a husband in return for promising not to drink any more coffee that she agrees.

&gt;Heute noch,  
Lieber Vater, tut es doch!  
Ach, ein Mann!  
Wahrlich, dieser steht mir an!  
Wenn es sich doch balde fügte,  
Dass ich endlich vor Coffee,  
Eh ich noch zu Bette geh,  
Einen wackern Liebsten kriegte!

But in the marriage contract, she has a clause included that allows her to drink as much coffee as she wants.

&gt;Kein Freier komm mir in das Haus,  
Er hab es mir denn selbst versprochen  
Und rück es auch der Ehestiftung ein,  
Dass mir erlaubet möge sein,  
Den Coffee, wenn ich will, zu kochen.

Bach wrote no operas. The cantata was written for concert performance, but is today frequently performed fully staged with costumes.

Here we hear and see a particularly entertaining performance by the Netherlands Bach Society, performed live on 17 May 2019 for the All of Bach project. Directed by Marc Pantus, musical director Shunske Sato, starring soprano Lucie Chartin, tenor Jan-Willem Schaafsma and baritone Mattijs van de Woerd.

634,Coffee,"Hi there! 

I lately started a small coldbrew side business where I sell bottled cold brew at coffeeshops and supermarkets. All of my previous brewing experiences have been with small batches of around 1lb per batch at a ratio of 1:12 coffee to water. This ready-to-drink ratio has been great with me with almost no negative feedbacks, until lately I have started brewing 2-2.5lb batches due to higher demand.

Using the same ratio of 1:12, my coffee is turning out to have an acidic aftertaste.. at first the coffee tastes good, but then tangyness/sourness hits and sticks in the mouth. The ratio that I used was 1300g coffee:15,600ml water (so again 1:12 ratio). 

I’m using the same coffee blend as for the small batches, which is 1/2 medium roast (not sure of the origin) with 1/2 Tanzanian from local coffee roaster ground at setting #7 (coarse grind here). The standard brewing time that I have always used has been 18 hours for the small batches, which is also the same time used for these large batches.

I am doubting the problem is one or more of the following: 
1. Brew time needs to be increased for these large batches, maybe increase to 24 hours as I’m suspecting that 18 hours is under-extracting.
2. My coffee blend needs to be adjusted for large batches, add more dark roast to increase bitterness - although I doubt it since using the same blend but with increased quantities shouldn’t be an issue OR my coffee roaster is messing up the blend.
3- Ground size needs to be adjusted to a finer setting sure.
4- all of them above...? (Worst case scenario)

What I’ve done so far to diagnose the problem: i’m brewing a new batch right now of ~700g coffee: 8400ml water (1:12 ratio), and will leave again for 24 hours this time. I’m not sure if this is the best approach but since the ratio is the same whether it’s for 5 pounds or 1 pounds, I’m assuming that problem can be narrowed down to either extraction time, grind size or coffee blend (roaster putting more light roast Tanzanian beans)


I would kindly appreciate all of your inputs/help on this subject, I am learning everyday and would love to learn from people who have been doing this a lot more than I have been.

Many thanks in advance 😊",Sour/Tangy Cold Brew for large batches?,"Hi there!

I just recently got into coffee; brewing a pour over (Melitta) every morning, a Chemex on the weekends, and sometimes an espresso (janky Amazon purchase.) We normally buy a 12oz bag of beans every two weeks or so. 

What I would like to learn, though, is how to buy beans on a specific flavor profile. Currently, we're just trying new bag after new bag. We're getting to the point, though, where we might like some consistency in flavors.

I know I could just continue to buy beans that I like, but I would rather learn how to buy beans based on the flavor profile that I'm looking for. I like a cup that expresses recognizable chocolate flavors (dark or milk), nutty tones, caramel or cream notes, and maybe a hint of berry. 

Is there a specific origin of beans I should be looking at or should I be looking at roast specifically? What washes or descriptions should I hone in on to search for those flavors? It's nice when some roasters put these notes on the bag, but it's not always consistent. I think Stumptown does this really well, for example.

I wanted a portable grinder to pair with my Aeropress so I started with the Porlex mini then after dropping and breaking the ceramic burr upgraded to the Aergrind. I enjoy hand grinding when camping but it takes forever. 

I'm a fit and able 40yr old man. I imagine I spin the thing as fast as recommended. It usually takes 3 minutes to grind 20g of light roast at 2:15 (2.25 turns from zero - anyone know why they went with clock graduations btw?) which is medium for me. I've heard reports of 45 seconds to grind. I feel like a lot of time is spent ""grinding air"" as though the beans are not being drawn into the grinder. I experiment with many different beans from light to dark roast - though a common variable is that I usually purchase from my local roaster.

Am I alone here? Is my roaster producing adamantium beans? Any of you have any similar experience? Solved it?

My google search turned up the Chemex Ottomatic 2.0 which has a warming plate but no remote/blue tooth connectivity. Is Bluetooth not a feature because leaving ground coffee overnight with a timer affect the quality of the cup? 

Is there a machine that will grind, brew, and keep warm a pot of pour over coffee that I can operate via Bluetooth?Does this machine exist?"

719,Coffee,"I typically use a Nespresso, but I had to move to another country for \~9 months and couldn't bring it so I bought a pretty cheap drip coffee maker, and I don't have much experience with these. 

My question is: lets say I use 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds, will using 2 ounces of water vs 4 vs 6 make any difference in the boldness of my coffee? 

Ive read some articles about making ""espresso"" with a drip coffee maker, and they almost always suggest using less water per grounds. However, I dont understand how this would possibly work. Its not like the machine is intelligent and would know how much water there is initially? Wouldn't it just brew at its full capacity until it runs out of water, thus making the same boldness coffee no matter what? 

In essence, what im trying to see is if I only put 2 ounces of water for 2tbs coffee, did I just ""lose"" an additional 4-6 ounces of coffee that I COULD have made? or is that 2 ounces actually bolder than if I used 6 ounces of water.

733,Coffee,"My frustration is caused by the fact that after years of trying I finally managed to make a good cup of coffee with chemex (or any other method). For two days I made great coffee with lots of fruity flavors (the beans are fresh (4 weeks old) light roasted Ethiopia Dimtu from a great local roaster). 

That was a couple of days ago. Since then I'm doing everything to recreate that couple of successful cups. A few quick words about my process: Barista Hustle styled water based on distilled water.  In the BH recipe I substitute some of magnesium with calcium (around 40ppm base, ~30ppm magnesiun, ~20ppm Ca). I'm grinding on Fellow Ode (tried everything between 2 and 5 setting) and use the smaller 3 cup chemex with standard white filters. Water temperature around 95 celsius (203 F) from Fellow EKG. I preheat the chemex and wet the paper with boiling water. 12g coffee to 200g water (1:16 - 1:17 ratio). I do one slow pour (Hoffmann style) with a swirl at the end. 45s bloom with vigorous swirling. My total draw down time is between 3 and 4 minutes depending on grind size. 

Now with exactly this process I managed to create great, fruity cups of coffee a couple of days ago. Before that I made coffee for years without any success whatsoever. But now that I tasted what good coffee tastes like I'm bitter (pun intended) that I can't do it no more. Since that successful couple of cups all my coffee is simply bitter. No fruit whatsoever. I tried grinding coarser and finer. I tried pouring more vigorously and more delicate. I tried changing the water temperature a couple degrees up and down. I tried pure 60ppm magnesium and 40ppm base water (original Barista Hustle). Absolutely nothing I do makes any difference - all I taste is less or more bitterness and no trace of fruit. The coffee is exactly the same from the same package. If I increase extraction the coffee has slightly more body and is thicker, but still the only taste I get is bitterness. When I decrease extraction slightly I get a more watery cup but still with only bitter tastes. Bitter as in 90% dark chocolate bitterness. 

Is there anything I can change or try to get more fruity coffee? Today I got desperate to nail it and made 10 cups with different parameters (described above). No luck. I'm really frustrated. Will I ever make a fruity cup of coffee like I managed to or is it pure luck and maybe I'll get one in a couple of weeks or months when the coffee gods smile on me?

772,Coffee,"Good afternoon,

I'm very easygoing with coffee. You'll laugh at my low bar of happiness but that's ok!

I like brewing a lot of coffee at once, storing it in vacuum containers and having it last me a couple of days. 

I was using a roughly 50oz french press for quite some time as my first setup. I was storing the coffee in an older 1qt 1970s Stanley vacuum container. Brought that with me and poured into a mug. Decent setup.

However, I purchased a Stanley master 1.4qt bottle and 20oz travel mug recently and like to fill both. This exceeds the capacity of my french press. I've since been loose brewing in my kettle then straining using a fine metal sieve into both containers and having hot coffee for the next 2-3 days. Also a decent setup.

My main concern is the sieve is definitely letting through some particles that I'd like to avoid. The coffee tastes fine otherwise, at least to my standards :)

Any suggestions on an easy solution to this? Filters look like they are mostly used for pour over which would take an incredibly long time to make 60+ oz of coffee at once.

I'm open to picking up things that would fulfill my needs, even if a little pricey. Making my own coffee saves a ton of money and I'm willing to invest to get it right, but also be easy.

Soooo I am a heavy coffee drinker. I come from the Balkans and we drink what is called in english - turkish coffee. I drink about 2 cups a day and 2-3 espresso shots for the last 5 years.

Then I got back to my usual routine. But now, for reasons unknown to me, I dont respond to coffee at all. Dont get me wrong, I like the aroma, the taste but it doesnt keep me awake anymore.

I enjoy coffee - especially making it.

Brewing with the Clever Dripper (30g coffee, 400g water, 5 minutes steep and release)

Espressos with fermented beans

Brews using the V60 haven't given me any trouble, I've been using Tetsu Kasuya method and my own 3x method without any issue.

Espressos that are ""simpler"" - I have less issue with. For example, chocolatey, nutty, washed espressos

My method is simple, dunk in two coffee measures (not sure if that's the English name for it) of cheap store-bought pre-ground, pour over roughly 30 cl of hot water, brew for 5 - 8 minutes, plunge, drink.

Then I just had to go and muck about with it.

Upgraded to whole beans, and bought a conical grinder, start experimenting with courseness/grind size and water temperature. So far so good. Coffee tastes even better.

I've had this experience with several different beans, from several different roasters. I thought maybe my press but I rinse that out after every use.

2) I've tried reading up on different method for the French press, as accordingly to most sources, my neanderthal way of doing it is plain wrong. So I've tried following James Hoffman's method, tried stirring, blooming, brewing without the lid (plunger) on top etc. This results in watered down, weak coffee every single time.

3) I was just gifted a box of the by far most expensive coffee I've ever had in my possession - Costa Rica Dona Daisy White Honey Gesha. I can't for the life of me get it to taste good. Its weak, watery and sour. I've tried other coffee from the same brand and it was sublime.

My second Oracle just conked out. This was after 30 months of usage

The original one started a heavy leak internally and it would leak water under the drip tray / housing body. Sent it off to repair. The 3rd party repair banged up a pretty flawless machine . It was shipped using the OEM Breville supplied box .

I complained about the condition about the banged up machine I received so I was sent a replacement (apparently brand new). Did not see any refurb markings, etc. Fast forward 30 months later

The machine will make some serious loud pump noise and it won't go away unless you pull the plug from the outlet. This happens when it's turned on or off. If you plug it back in, the same loud pump noise is present. 

What's even more crazy is this behaviour I speak of.  It will do it on it's own even with the unit plugged in / and turned off. Aka, after using it and the machine is turned off. Anywhere from 45 minutes later, maybe 2 hrs later. Machine not turned on, display is not \*on\*. The loud pump noise will turn on and it will not go away unless unplugged.

I'm leaving it unplugged as I don't want to burn the house down.....Until my replacement arrives. Right now, in the morning, about half the time I plug it in, I can get by with it warming up and being able to use it. Other times,  when I plug it in, a few minutes later, the pump will go AWOL.

846,Coffee,"Hi, I'm pretty new into this world and I've been making my coffee in a small 2-cup (200ml) Moka and I've kind of been wanting a pour over filter maker for a long time, but because I drink that small quantity of coffee and I don't plan on drinking more, I need a small pour over maker.

The thing is that I've been looking for makers around that quantity (maybe I can go up to 300ml but not much more) and I don't find any with a Chemex-like style, which is what I want to buy.

I've found one that I like, [this Bodum](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LQ2PZDW), but is 500ml.

900,Coffee,"I picked up a Hario V60 plastic dripper, some Hario bleached filters, and have some new coffee I want to try as a pour-over.   Not because my Moccamaster doesn't make a good cup, but because I want a little more control, and because the procedure of making the coffee is a large part of my enjoyment of the drink. 

I've seen pour-over advice all over the map.   Some say grind medium-fine, some say medium-coarse, some say 1:15 ratio is optimal, others lean towards 1:18 on dose.   Then, there's the 1/3 bloom, 2/3 steady pour method, and the 4:6 method.  etc.   Seems like many variations, so I am trying to pick ""one"" to start with, to get my toes wet..

Hearing about the 4:6 method, I understand the concepts and watched Tetsu's original video describing the process.   I have my grind set so that I am flowing the first 20% right off the boil takes 45 seconds until the top of the bed just starts to dry out, then 20%, wait 45 seconds, bed dries out a bit, etc.   By the time I get to my 80% and 100% pours (#4 and #5) of 60ml each, my bed is taking progressively longer to filter through.   It takes approximately 3.5 to 4 minutes my cup to finish from first pour. 

So far, so good -- now the questions: 

\#1 Each pour takes successively longer to draw down until the top of the bed starts showing.   Is this typical? 

\#2 Do you adjust your time between the pours, or do you stay fixed at 40/45/50 seconds etc. and just do your 20/40/60/80/100 pour ""by the clock"" ignoring the bed?

I've only run through a few cups with the dripped, and this third cup is the best yet.  Am I missing anything?

My problem is, I have NEVER had so many coffee grounds all over my countertops in all my life... The grinder I was given is one of those where the lid fits inside the grinding compartment, (it's a Krups if that matters) so I have to turn it upsidedown and tap it on the counter to catch all the grounds in the lid, then use the lid to pour grounds into my pour-over filter (if I ever hope to put the lid back on without wedging grounds in-between it and the interior walls of the grinder.) This process always, without fail sends about a tps+ of grounds flying all over the place by the time I'm done putting it all back together.

Am I doing something wrong? Is the grinder I was given just a bad design?? Is this mess just an inherent part of using a grinder???

981,Coffee,"Hi, I have a Graef CM702 grinder (entry level, steel conical burr,, \~100 EUR), and a hand grinder for travel (Hario Mini Mill).

I usually brew with a V60 (\~80% of the time), sometimes with Aeropress (\~15%), rarely with a Brikka (\~5%). The typical quantity is 24-42 g for a brew (with the V60), a bit too much for my hand grinder, and sometimes I brew around 2x40 in a row (way too much handwork).

The Graef can be offseted with washers, so I have managed to have a good scale of grind sizes for my needs, with various coffees. The uniformity of the grind is not the best. Overall, it is a good enough set-up. But I am thinking about an upgrade (and I would sell the older grinder(s), or gifted out). The two (+1) factors I would pay for are:

1. The Greaf have quite a good (bad) amount of retention. Any grinder with same overall quality but with smaller retention would be a nice upgrade.

2. About four times a year, I have to travel with the Graef instead of the hand grinder (because the lot of grinding there). I am careful but I will break the container one day, that is for sure. A lighter/smaller machine would be a step forward, one with no fragile parts would be a real upgrade.

\+ More uniform grind size would be a nice thing to have, but I am afraid it will be the most expensive step.

I'm tired of not milking the full potential of my beans by only having regular filter coffee so I just decided to buy an espresso machine. I've been researching manual and automatic ones. Although I like the convenience of automatic machines, I am concerned the outcome flavor of the espresso might not be ideal with them. I like a strong, aromatic shot and I'm not sure autos provide that. The current machine I'm looking into is Philips 3200 LatteGo Series. Am I better off getting a manual lever action machine?

1020,Coffee,"I received my K2 less than a week ago, didn’t have much time for an extensive experience with it but so far I’m very happy with this acquisition.

My requirements:

- it should grind fine and precise enough for espresso;
- it should be more an entry level price, less than 100 dollars. I was not considering a Comandante, Kinu etc.
- it should be faster than a Timemore C2 (my brother lent me his) which I was using to grind circa 15g in about 2 min (click 8 or 9)

My options, rationale and decision:

Before buying, I was in doubt between a 1zpresso Q2, JX, JX Pro and the Kingrinder family.

The Q2 and K2 are about the same price, 1zpresso is more renowned, and it’s very difficult to find good reviews in English for the K2.

I was very much inclined to buy the Q2 because the JX and JX Pro are significantly more expensive. However, the Q2 is definitely for pour over and some people reported that it would be difficult to grind more than 18g and I wanted ideally the capability to grind 20g at least. The great majority of the reviewers I found didn’t recommend the Q2 for espresso, in the beginning I thought it would be manageable but I became more concerned with the steps’ size the more I researched the Q2.

Another important detail: the K2 has the same burrs used in JX and JX Pro. 

In terms of precision, the K2 has 18 microns per click, an intermediary position between the JX (25 microns), and JX Pro (12.5 microns). It is important to notice that 1zpresso recommends JX for pour over and JX Pro for espresso, and that Kingrinder recommends K2 for pour over and K3 for espresso.

The K3 is not much more expensive than a K2, however, the titanium coated burrs tend to be slower to grind, and as a beginner I believed that I wouldn’t be so sensitive to the difference in flavor but definitely wanted a faster grinder.

The few reviews found were very positive about the K2. It was also mentioned somewhere (and I couldn’t validate) that Kingrinder and 1zpresso were the same company in the past but  after splitting the latter became more renowned and this would be the reason for a premium price on very similar products.

Considering that K2 was cheaper (90 dollars against 130 bucks for a JX) and more precise, I decided to give K2 a chance.

Pros:

- The K2 is really fast. I can grind 15g for espresso in 30-40s

- It is precise enough for me, a beginner. I need to make a few tests with 1 click difference to tell you more objectively how faster or slower are the shots. I’ll add this info later. I could also notice that it produces less fines than the Timemore C2 (please be aware that it’s very subjective), or at least I didn’t feel, for a similar ground size, the fines in the mouth that I could do when using the click 8 in a C2.

- The construction is very good. Almost 100% metallic. Only the lid is plastic and the knob is wooden.

- Price: it’s the best cost-benefit option in my view. At least, I couldn’t find a better option in the 90 bucks range (Aug 2021).

- It is officially allowed to adapt a power screwdriver for those who wants (the manual shows how to). I believe then that it was designed for it and you shouldn’t be ruining your grinder if you do so. But I didn’t test, less so did an endurance test, thus it’s at your own risk.

Cons:

- Ergonomics: it was much harder to grind the same coffee in a K2 than in a Timemore C2. Maybe because the K2 has larger burrs (48mm against 38mm in a C2), or maybe because it was designed to grind faster. I don’t know exactly. But the Timemore C2 takes much longer to grind the safe coffee at the same granularity level.

- It was especially difficult to grind medium-light roasts, which is expected since lighter roasts are less brittle. But it was too hard in my view. The solution I found was to incline the grinder (supported on my lap) to feed the beans slower in the chamber. It didn’t increase a lot the grinding time, maybe by 5s, which was ok for me, it’s still a very fast grinder in my view.

Manual: very concise, don’t have ranges recommended for each preparation method which could be very helpful for a quick start. A bit confuse to understand the role of each silicon ring and when to remove each.

Package and amenities: it’s a completely no frills box and accessories. It includes only a single brush and manual, no bags or blowers, very simple and fragile cardbox and foam packaging.

Conclusion:

I’m very happy so far, the performance is great on what matters most today for me, and for this price I didn’t find anything close to what a K2 delivers.",Kingrinder K2 - first impressions,"I received my K2 less than a week ago, didn’t have much time for an extensive experience with it but so far I’m very happy with this acquisition.

However, the Q2 is definitely for pour over and some people reported that it would be difficult to grind more than 18g and I wanted ideally the capability to grind 20g at least. The great majority of the reviewers I found didn’t recommend the Q2 for espresso, in the beginning I thought it would be manageable but I became more concerned with the steps’ size the more I researched the Q2.

Another important detail: the K2 has the same burrs used in JX and JX Pro. 

In terms of precision, the K2 has 18 microns per click, an intermediary position between the JX (25 microns), and JX Pro (12.5 microns). It is important to notice that 1zpresso recommends JX for pour over and JX Pro for espresso, and that Kingrinder recommends K2 for pour over and K3 for espresso.

The K3 is not much more expensive than a K2, however, the titanium coated burrs tend to be slower to grind, and as a beginner I believed that I wouldn’t be so sensitive to the difference in flavor but definitely wanted a faster grinder.

The few reviews found were very positive about the K2. It was also mentioned somewhere (and I couldn’t validate) that Kingrinder and 1zpresso were the same company in the past but  after splitting the latter became more renowned and this would be the reason for a premium price on very similar products.

Considering that K2 was cheaper (90 dollars against 130 bucks for a JX) and more precise, I decided to give K2 a chance.

Pros:

- The K2 is really fast. I can grind 15g for espresso in 30-40s

- It is precise enough for me, a beginner. I need to make a few tests with 1 click difference to tell you more objectively how faster or slower are the shots. I’ll add this info later. I could also notice that it produces less fines than the Timemore C2 (please be aware that it’s very subjective), or at least I didn’t feel, for a similar ground size, the fines in the mouth that I could do when using the click 8 in a C2.

- The construction is very good. Almost 100% metallic. Only the lid is plastic and the knob is wooden.

- Price: it’s the best cost-benefit option in my view. At least, I couldn’t find a better option in the 90 bucks range (Aug 2021).

- It is officially allowed to adapt a power screwdriver for those who wants (the manual shows how to). I believe then that it was designed for it and you shouldn’t be ruining your grinder if you do so. But I didn’t test, less so did an endurance test, thus it’s at your own risk.

Cons:

- Ergonomics: it was much harder to grind the same coffee in a K2 than in a Timemore C2. Maybe because the K2 has larger burrs (48mm against 38mm in a C2), or maybe because it was designed to grind faster. I don’t know exactly. But the Timemore C2 takes much longer to grind the safe coffee at the same granularity level.

- It was especially difficult to grind medium-light roasts, which is expected since lighter roasts are less brittle. But it was too hard in my view. The solution I found was to incline the grinder (supported on my lap) to feed the beans slower in the chamber. It didn’t increase a lot the grinding time, maybe by 5s, which was ok for me, it’s still a very fast grinder in my view.

Manual: very concise, don’t have ranges recommended for each preparation method which could be very helpful for a quick start. A bit confuse to understand the role of each silicon ring and when to remove each.

Package and amenities: it’s a completely no frills box and accessories. It includes only a single brush and manual, no bags or blowers, very simple and fragile cardbox and foam packaging.

Conclusion:

I’m very happy so far, the performance is great on what matters most today for me, and for this price I didn’t find anything close to what a K2 delivers.Kingrinder K2 - first impressions"

I found an old moka pot around the house, its stainless steel and seems pretty good.

It was very dirty, the base where you add the water to had a thick black crust which was very hard to remove and all around it was dirty, i deep cleaned it thorougly, Now it looks like new except on the base where there a couple of old stain marks but i dont think its dirt.

However when i started doing water only runs to get the last bits of dirt out of the pot, small black sediments always come out, i think they are comming from the inside of the center pipe, which cannot be dissasembled.

Anyone has any idea on how i could clean this best? Maybe add a solution to water when doing cleaning runs or submerging the whole thing or?

1030,Coffee,"My DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM3300 was purchased in 2012. I've done some maintenance on it over the years including replacing the main control panel, a few water connectors, o-rings, etc. All in all VERY pleased with the longevity of the machine as it nears its 9th birthday.

Got some leaks on the counter today, opened it up and it appears to be coming directly from the boiler/generator assembly. The metal had shown some signs of corrosion over the years but nothing catastrophic.

I suspect that replacing the generator assembly for $100 would solve this but I'm mindful that that's an expensive repair on a machine where most every other part in it is also 9 years old. If I replace it I'd be hard pressed to get anything other than the identical machine which I see is still sold on Amazon. That said, we \*never\* use the frother. We're strictly esperesso and Americano drinkers and so I've always had the feeling that the machine is more complex than it needs to be for our particular usage. Which brings me to 2 questions:

1) Am I correct in thinking that 9 years is a very long life for a super automatic and replacing it vs a relatively time-consuming and expensive repair is not foolish? and

2) Are there better super automatics out there for strict espresso/Americano production? It looks like the Jura A1 might fit the bill but I don't see anything from DeLonghi.

Any advice is helpful honestly as a newbie to the whole espresso loving lifestyle!

Thanks,New machine advice"

I was way too excited to set it up so I brewed my first cup of coffee out of my brandy new Bonmac dripper. I'm sure by most of your standards it was hot garbage but I think it's probably the best cup I've ever had.

Like, who knew coffee could taste sweet and sour, does that make sense? Kinda tangy, maybe that's the acidity? I have literally no idea what I was tasting but I liked it, a lot. Took too long to brew, gonna make it more course tomorrow morning, see what that does to it. My kettle is crap but it was used for tea and the occasional french press only, no need for a gooseneck to do that. I am already thinking about a kettle upgrade being the next purchase.

Now I need to figure out where to buy some beans that are cheap enough I won't feel bad using a big old chunk of em' for cold brew, the only coffee my wife will drink and are good enough to beat the ones I got at Walmart. Like I literally just chose based on the most pretentious verbiage on the bad I could find. Also, it was a medium roast, I mean, not at all anything remotely similar to what I would drink usually.

I purchased a [French Press Coffee Maker](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07ZQGMXVC/) yesterday and I loved the fuller taste I got in my cuppa. However I have two questions about the whole process:

1. How is this different than just dumping the freshly grinded (coarse) coffee powder in my water heating pan and then waiting for 4 minutes, then filtering it into my drinking cup?
2. I have been drinking instant coffee till now which was always hotter then what I got because I waited for four minutes for the brewing process to complete. (I had pre-warmed the boro-silicate glass before pouring the hot water. I brought the water to full boil, let it sit for 1 min, then poured it in the pre-warmed boro-silicate glass, waited 4 minutes.) But the result was a pretty luke-warm coffee, not the hot one which I usually get from instant.

What should I be doing differently?

I've bought a generic manual grinder from China and I'm using the Melitta 102 brewing method (the cheapest here in Brazil).

I've bought some specialty coffee beans from local roasters and I've been trying without success to achieve the sweet cup of coffee. 

I don't have a gooseneck kettle (using my mock pot as a kettle), I don't have a kitchen thermometer and don't have a good grinder. 

Trying to eliminate one of the variables I went to a local coffee shop and bought a fresh roasted coffee and asked them to grind for Melitta.

At home, I got my first incredible sweet coffee \o/ .... but only once 😢

I tried more three times without success. 

My question is, is it so fragile to get a great coffee using Melitta pour over? 

This was the recipe Melitta 102:

12 g coffee 
200 g water 
Grind medium (by coffee shop professional grinder) 
Heat : about 4-5 min after boiling 

Bloom 32 g for 30 s

Pour 31g slowly (10 sec) zig zag

Pour 26 g (10 sec) circular feom edge to center

1097,Coffee,"I am fond of saying to anyone who will listen that after almost 30 years of drinking bad coffee, Because I had no choice (29 years in the military) I could now choose to drink a good cup of coffee.  For the past two years I’ve been trying for making a consistent cup of good coffee.  I recently started watching videos by James Hoffmann and others, and feel like I’m getting educated.  

I also love gadgets.  On this adventure path, I have bought a V60, Chemex, Bialetti Moka pot, and stainless French press.  I have a couple of cheap hand grinders (Javapress and a Hario Skerton). Most recently, I bought an 1zpresso K-plus hand grinder.  

According to the 1zpresso manual, each click of the grinder is 22 microns.  I’ve been trying to focus on the v60 and from what I can read I should be grinding between 400-600 microns. At 400 the grounds looked like melted chocolate/mud after the brew, and I’m pretty sure it started melting the spoon I put in the cup(haha).  I believe the cup was over extracted.  This morning I ground to approximately 800 microns (37 clicks) and it was better but still a bit too bitter for my tastes.  

I bought the beans from a local cafe and it is a medium-dark roast blend (Sumatran I think) and the beans are a month past roast date.  Outside of the age of the coffee, which is probably past it’s prime, I’m not sure if I am still grinding too fine for the roast type.  Also, I’m using a 30g coffee to 500ml water ratio. (208F/98C)

Any advice on some adjustments would be greatly appreciated.  I do realize I should get fresher coffee.  I should also mention that I’m keeping the coffee in a “coffee” canister on my shelf.  It has some type of filter in the lid.

1098,Coffee,"My wife and I just moved from the US to Denmark and due to baggage limitations and wanting to avoid a clunky transformer, I needed to buy all new coffee electric equipment. I brew 1-3 times a day using a V60 for black filter coffee and a moka pot for macchiato/cortado type milk drinks.
   
Replaced my Bonavita variable temp with a Hario Buono stovetop which is definitely an upgrade because of how slow I can pour without breaking the stream and on induction it heats faster than electric anyway. I also got an electric hot and cold milk frother which also feels like an upgrade from the small saucepan and immersion blender attachment since it never scalds and makes beautiful foam I previously thought required steam.
   
The big disappointment was the grinder. My previous $80 DeLonghi-Ariete was bulky but delivered pretty pretty consistent grind and I was able to learn where to tap and shake it to prevent build up. It's replacement is the Wilfa Il Solito which cost about the same and I was initially very excited. The brand reputation was backed up by what feels like much higher end build quality and I thought I'd love how much easier it is to adjust the burr setting. However, using this thing has been a messy nightmare. Every inch of the thing has fines trapping pockets that are hard to clean even with a toothbrush. Removing the grounds bin sends up a cloud of coffee across the kitchen every time and after a single use the side window the grounds spit out of is over 50% clogged and ready to spill everywhere. I've given up on coming close to emptying the container as those last bits that stick to everything go everywhere except the moka pot basket or filter paper. And then to top it all off there is way more variance in the grind size. Every setting leaves a much higher % of fines and anything other than the finest couple notches lets through tons of huge boulders.
   
Despite the huge mess, the overall setup works well enough for brewing extra strong moka pots that are always tempered by great foamy milk, but I'm yet to come to close to the pour overs I'm used to despite my pouring technique improving drastically with the better kettle. The boulders leave the brew very under extracted and weak while the fines make it all taste like muddy sludge. 
   
Does anyone have any advice on getting more out of this grinder? Or am I better off selling it used and upgrading to something in the $125-175 range so I can be done with the headache.",Wilfa Il Solito grinder advice,"My wife and I just moved from the US to Denmark and due to baggage limitations and wanting to avoid a clunky transformer, I needed to buy all new coffee electric equipment.

1099,Coffee,"Howdy y'all,

Former coffee professional (aka barista) here. I worked for specialty coffee roasters for several years, and became spoiled by access to great coffee brewing equipment. I've been out of the industry for a little over a year, and I'm looking to step up my at-home brew game.

I currently have a breville dose control pro that's about 7 years old. It gets the job done, but leaves a little to be desired in terms of particle size distribution and I'm wondering if there's anything currently on the market for less than $300 that will make a marked improvement. Particle size distribution is about the only thing care about, followed by durability/structural integrity. I don't care about bells and whistles, manual or electric, Bluetooth connectivity, aesthetics, form factor, or anything like that — I'm just after good coffee.

I'm out of the loop as to what's out there on the consumer market, and rather than sifting through reviews and blogs and slogging through YouTube videos (sorry, Mr. Hoffman, ily), I figured I'd ask y'all.

For reference, I do most of my brewing at ≤ 600μm.

A bit of back story : My coffee journey started with fresh ground French press coffee which I adored for about a year then I was gifted an old rancillio silvia. This was my first experience making espresso and after a great deal of practice I moved onto cappuccino and latte's and got pretty good at latte art. Sadly the boiler in my silvia died and while I can easily fix it at that time I was into milk drinks and the breville dual boiler was only $600 with my staff discount (that's AUD$) so I jumped on it. Eventually I moved back into espresso and finally settled on long black as my go to drink for the last \~4 years. My preferred cup is 100ml of water with 18g of beans to 36g of espresso in 35 seconds, every morning I hit this mark with only a second or so either side of 35 seconds.

Recently I was given a few samples (50g) of experimental roasts from my local coffee roaster to try. Each of the 5 roasts are light to medium and after letting them rest for a few days over 1 week they are ready to try. This morning in my sleepy haze I went to my go to 18g dose over 100ml of water and while the shot was pulling I usually give my bench a once over with my coffee cloth and when I looked back over to my machine I freaked and hit stop. My 18g was pulling a modest 6.5bars instead of 9 and had hit 45.8g of extraction. To my surprise it wasn't to bad very different but not bad.

Should I dial in my shot to pull at higher pressures or should I leave it at around the 6.5 bar mark? Currently I have my machine set to 7 seconds pre-infusion at 92°C. I'm sad to say that even after home brewing for 10 years I've never dabbled in light roasts so I have no idea what I'm aiming for.

What could I replace it with that will give a similar smooth flavour? Ideally something that can do one cup or an entire jug.

Hello, in recent years I invest very much in coffee and I read about it a lot but all these years I was involved only with filter coffees (V60 and Aeropress primarily), and last few days I decide to dive into espresso and see what I can do. So I buy a very Moded Gaggia Classic with an Ascaso isteel i1. I try a lot of coffees and a lot of adjustments but my shot is always very acid (or bitter, I can't decide) in the aftertaste. For example, if I take a big sip when I swallow the coffee the acidity (or bitterness) kind of burns my throat.

Here is every Infos I can provide to you about the shots.

* I use 21gr of coffee and a 2:1 ratio
* The coffee I use is [this](https://imgur.com/a/vunLjdW)
* The first drops appear at 6 seconds and the brew stops at around 28 secs
* My shot looks like [this](https://imgur.com/a/hukpCiE)
* And my puck like [this](https://imgur.com/a/d18Klxn)
* I use double filtered water and my machine is always as clean as possible

So this is everything I can provide to you. My question is do I do something wrong and my shots taste like this or this is what should taste (Again I was primarily a filter coffee nerd).

I made my very 1st batch of french press coffee, wow! It was surely a different experience, needless to say I will be experimenting more with this new coffee journey. 
Anyways, I will like to get some suggestions on what people do with the leftover coffee grounds after the brew? (Besides dumping it in the trash of course). 
Any reusable suggestions?

Took the screw out and the burrs, did a deep clean of everything, used a brush as much as I could to clean the chute. Still, when I do a medium grind it just gets jammed up until I change it to coarse level 13-15.

Anything else I can try or is it time to replace it?

1205,Coffee,"Hi guys,

the last days i was looking for entry level hand grinders my budget is 60$ max (less would be better). I read a lot about the Timemore C2 and think it would a good option. By chance i discovered the Xeoleo 50mm hand grinder which is listed for about 41 USD on aliexpress. It seems that it has exactly the same grinding core as the C2 and even is made completely out of aluminum instead of having some plastic parts. The other parts look equal as well.

The only obvious downsides would be increased weight of ~150g and that it can hold 5g less beans. Both of these points are negligible for my use cases.

I can't find much in-depth information about this grinder besides a few mentions on here.

Can you guys tell me if they are really comparable or if maybe someone ones a Xeoleo 50mm can share his experience? Or is the Xeoleo inferior to the C2 in some other non-obvious ways?

It seems that there are many clones or rebranded versions with the same components as the C2. Are they any good?

However, they give off a pleasant aroma akin to the flavor notes while brewing, and a month doesn't seem like long enough for a sealed bag of beans to completely lose flavor and sweetness. Is there a chance I'm doing something wrong? I'm a bit in denial hahaStale beans?"
1244,Coffee,"A few days ago I screwed up my math and accidentally created a really interesting cup of decaf – it tasted almost like juice, it was a bit watery but acidic and sweet with no discernible bitterness. My roommate tasted it and had a similar experience. I'd really like to be able to replicate this, but have failed so far.

Here's all the relevant information I can think of:

* It was a very hot evening, inside of the house was about 30 degrees C
* It was the first grind on a brand new 1zpresso JX, at 2.5 rotations (100 clicks)
* Filtered tap water at 92 degrees
* 15 g coffee to 175 ml water
* The recipe I used was Stall the Fall[0]: Hario Switch, pour the water in first, then add the grounds, then stir for 30s and drain

Has anyone had cups of decaf like this and figured out how to make them consistently? I've tried to replicate the recipe as closely as possible, but end up with cups that are mostly bitter and tasteless.

1255,Coffee,"Over the last several years I've explored more and more different coffee roasts because I like to try all sorts of new things when it comes to something I like. Especially with coffee. One of my favorite roasters that I've found is Kings Coast Coffee roasters in New York City. They've made some of the best barrel aged coffees I've ever had, most notable is their rum and, oddly enough, tequila barrel aged coffees. (If you get a chance to snag one of their tequila barrel aged coffees, do it. You will not regret it). But the coffees Kings Coast makes that I can not stand is their light and bright coffees. The process of such coffees apparently entails leaving a bit of the originally berry meat on the bean when it is roasted. I tried one for the first time last year because the flavor notes interested me: honey comb, juicy pineapple and mango. When I read that, I thought it would be like a coffee I got from my favorite local shop in Austin, Summer Moon Coffee, where it had notes of walnut, chocolate, and just a subtle hint of apple. Really delicious stuff that I hope Summer Moon will make again someday. But the light and bright coffee I got from Kings Coast was like a fruit punch coffee. The fruit flavors it had were so overpowering, I and the coworkers I shared the coffee with immediately spit it out and brewed a new pot of French roast. I couldn't understand why anyone would like such coffee, but I saw Kings Coast made another batch of that same coffee earlier this year. And for their anniversary today, they're releasing a new coffee that is also light and bright with tasting notes of honey and fruit. So has anyone ever tried such coffee before?

1257,Coffee,"I just received my new 1Zpresso J-Max in the mail yesterday and thought I'd share a few of my initial opinions in case it may help anyone interested in picking one of these up. Keep in mine my use is primarily for espresso only, so your experience for other brew methods may be different.

**Pros:**

This grinder feels very well-made. It feels like they built a nice product that should last for years of daily use.

The adjustability is great. It's got a lot of range to fine tune grind size, and it seems very consistent. The external dial is easy to use with big numbers, and the pyramid-style indicator makes it easy to know what setting you're on without resetting to zero. The detents they use to stop at each grind step have a nice 'click' sound that's really pleasant.

While I don't plan to travel with it, I do like that it includes the carry case. It's a nice place to store the additional accessories (air blower, brush) that come with the grinder.

**Cons:**

I find it *impossible* to maintain a positive grip through 17-18g of beans, especially when grinding light to medium-light roasts for espresso, which is admittedly difficult to grind but one of my main use cases. I consider my hands are fairly average in size for an adult male, and I can't find a place to consistently hold this grinder without running into some form of trouble.

Holding too low, the magnetic catch bin falls off while grinding, which makes a fairly significant mess. I found this out the hard way... several times.

Holding too high, the adjustment ring can twist, changing the grind size while turning the handle.

I've seen mention that you can't wash this grinder with water, which is a longer-term concern for me. The included air blower does a decent job of getting out the grinds, but eventually it would need a much deeper clean.

**Conclusion:**

After the positive reviews I've read online, I really wanted to like this grinder. Considering this is a $200 USD hand grinder, I'm really struggling with the idea that it can be so finicky on the ergonomics. While I acknowledge I could probably practice holding it more strategically to work around some of these problems, I don't agree with it on principle and likely won't be keeping this grinder.",1Zpresso J-Max First Impressions,"I just received my new 1Zpresso J-Max in the mail yesterday and thought I'd share a few of my initial opinions in case it may help anyone interested in picking one of these up.

1272,Coffee,"Little bit of background - 

For the past handful of years, I've been using a Keurig to brew a French Roast SF Bay Coffee with the 'strong' button, usually 6 or 8 oz. It's dark, bold, and can stand up to some creamer. I'm sure no coffee aficionado would like it, but I always look forward to the cup.

I decided to go one step better, but for convenience got a superautomatic Philips 3200 LatteGo (my wife likes lattes).

I've brewed/wasted a dozen or so cups while the machine 'calibrates' (what exactly is happening during this process? How sentient is this machine?). I am using medium roast, which is what the machine recommends to not clog the grinders with oil, although I do have on order some Koffee Club Dark Roast, which they say is fine for superautos.

The coffee so far is terrible to me. However, it's not clear to me if I just don't have a real appreciation for medium roast good quality fresh coffee (the beans are freshly roasted from Bones coffee) or if something is wrong. I get this aftertaste it in the back of my mouth with every sip. I don't know if it's what is supposed to be 'brightness' or acidity. I've seen the negative term 'sour' thrown around, and because the taste is offputting to me, I'd liken it more to sour than bright.

I turned down the grind setting to slightly finer. I'm brewing the strongest cup possible (the 3 bean setting), with the medium water, it turns out to be less than 6 oz, which is a smaller cup of coffee than I like drinking.

There is no body (I think that is the correct term) to the cup of coffee whatsoever. A drop of creamer turns the whole cup white, and also makes the entire cup lukewarm, whereas the Keurig cup can hold up to way more creamer, maintains a darker color, and stays hot.

Is the machine defective? It is a certified refurb.

Follow up question - what the machine calls 'Coffee', what exactly is it? I assume the Keurig is closer to a drip coffee, but this is closer to a Lungo or Americano? Is that correct?",Getting a 'sour' (I think?) taste from SuperAutomatic coffee - help please!,"Little bit of background - 

For the past handful of years, I've been using a Keurig to brew a French Roast SF Bay Coffee with the 'strong' button, usually 6 or 8 oz. It's dark, bold, and can stand up to some creamer. I'm sure no coffee aficionado would like it, but I always look forward to the cup.

I decided to go one step better, but for convenience got a superautomatic Philips 3200 LatteGo (my wife likes lattes).

I've brewed/wasted a dozen or so cups while the machine 'calibrates' (what exactly is happening during this process? How sentient is this machine?). I am using medium roast, which is what the machine recommends to not clog the grinders with oil, although I do have on order some Koffee Club Dark Roast, which they say is fine for superautos.

The coffee so far is terrible to me.

I generally like the coffee (depending on the beans used) but I pretty much hate the grinding, waiting for blooming, cleaning of frenchpress. So I'd like to buy sth that will get me good cup of coffee with very low amount of work :) 

Friend of mine does have full-auto delonghi (magnifica ecam) but I am not the biggest fan of the coffee it makes, to me it tastes kind of stale? Also I would love to be able to make nice Flat White (my favorite coffee in coffee shop) :) 

I did some reading and I have came to 2 options:  
1) Breville (Sage/Catler) Barista Express -&gt; which I can get (used) for 350$  
2) Breville (Sage/Catler)  Bambino Plus -&gt; used 220$ &amp; Wilfa Svart Classic Aroma for 90$

Which of these options is better or do you think I should look elsewhere? I really love the ""one box to rule them all"" of Barista Express.

Btw: I am in EU market -&gt; some stuff around here is way more expensive - and some stuff cheaper than in the US.

Or is my thinking completely flawed :)",Quick &amp; Easy Espresso,"Hi guys,

1318,Coffee,"During the pandemic when local coffee shops don't get much consumers, 1000ml bottled coffee became very popular in my country.

They make fresh bottled coffee mostly for 1000ml, though sometimes it can be 250ml or 500ml. There are variants as well with different kind of coffee (and non coffee), but the most popular ones are the coffee lattes. Some coffee shops can even get very popular solely bcs of it.

The trend makes so much sense since a lot of people are working from home and we are addicted with drinking coffee. Also, the bottled ones are cheaper since you're buying it in bulk and you can adjust the ice ratio.

Some bottled flavored lattes can even taste better after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days since the flavor can get very rich.

I've tried a bit of googling but I don't see this trend anywhere else.
Some of my guess:
- Is it because it's common for you to make (good) coffee at home? Like, it's common to have some kind of coffee maker concuction?
- Are lattes not that popular? (The lattes sell a lot.)
- I see that they sell bottled coffee in supermarkets, is it the same as the fresh bottled coffee made by our local coffee shops? We also have bottled and canned coffee at the supermarket, but it tastes very different, very artificial.

I was recently in the market for a new hand grinder, but didn't want to break the bank on a JX so I started looking for other options. I came across the Heihox manual grinder and couldn't find many reviews, so I decided to take a chance and review it myself for anyone who was curious. My previous grinder was an ultra-cheap no-name ceramic burr grinder that I received as a gift, and as I have a very difficult time refusing gifts I tricked it out and used it as long as I could. So fair warning, my standards may be very low. 

Construction appears to be very nice. The handle is made of stainless steel and walnut, and turns smoothly. The entire body is an aluminum alloy, and all of the major parts are stainless steel. The main shaft is supported by two ball bearings - no bushings here. The design is simple and elegant, and is reminiscent of the JZ or the Timemore C2. So far I have not seen any burrs or casting flash on the grinder. The adjustment system feels pretty solid, and if it were to unscrew I feel like it would be obvious. This model has a screw-on base. Some of the earlier models had a rubber gasket/pressure fit, but thankfully I think they've done away with that.

Adjusting the grinder is easy, just loosen/tighten the knob to grind coarser/finer. The manual says that the adjustment ranges from 0 to 24 clicks and gives guidelines for the style of coffee, but I find them to be a little off. It could be different for each one. For example, it says 6-12 clicks for espresso, but IMO that would be way too coarse and 10 clicks is a good start for pour over. I did test out 5 clicks and it was pretty fine, but I'm not sure if it's enough for espresso as I don't currently have a machine. I do have plans to build a lever espresso machine, so at that point I'll be able to comment on its espresso capabilities. 

The grinder easily holds 30g of coffee, and I was able to stuff 38g in there when I filled it to the brim. I measured the inner burr to be about a 30mm diameter; I'm not sure how this compares to other grinders since I'm not sure exactly how they measure the burrs. Grinding 20g of medium coffee on 10 clicks (a good starting point for pour over) took about 1min 15sec. Obviously coarser coffee will require less time and finer coffee more time.

**Concerns and potential tweaks:**

I remember a review or two saying that after a while the mechanism would come unscrewed, but all it needed was to be re-tightened. I'm not sure if this model includes a fix or if the problem still exists, but if anything were to unscrew, then the grinder would come out of adjustment and eventually disassemble as completely unscrewing the adjustment knob on the bottom loosens the burrs and allows for removal of all the parts. There is a spring that keeps the adjustment from coming out, and as you loosen the adjustment, the spring applies less pressure, which could contribute to the loosening problem that I read about. An easy fix would be to add a spacer or get a stiffer spring if this is the case. Again, this has not happened to me, and if it did I feel like it would be obvious.  
One thing that I would have liked to see (and that I tweaked myself) is a reference point on the grinder adjustment. Something like a mark or notch every ten clicks or so for easy adjustment for people who brew using multiple methods. I did this by starting at 0 and making a mark at 10 clicks, and then taking the mechanism out and using a drill to make a permanent notch there.  
Another note on espresso: When it comes to hand grinders, it's hard to find a budget grinder that has enough minute adjustments to dial in espresso. For example, the JZ Pro is capable of espresso, but the Standard JZ is not, mainly due to the fineness of the adjustment. One way to get more adjustment would be to add more ""steps"" to the adjustment knob buy milling more notches in and then you'd get twice as many steps. This is not for the faint of heart, but as I have experience in machining it's not something I'm afraid to take on.  
There is some very slight offset in the shaft as it spins freely. So straightening the shaft is an option to correct this, but imo it's not worth it unless you really want to dial in espresso as it is so very slight. This may be common in budget/midrange hand grinders.

**TLDR:**

For $60 it's a great budget grinder and from other reviews that I've seen will most likely outperform anything else in its price range and possibly above. You will not be disappointed unless you want to grind for espresso, and even then some of the tweaks mentioned above for a mechanically inclined person might make that possible.",HEIHOX Hand Grinder First Impression and Review,"Skip to the end for TLDR

1349,Coffee,"Hi,

In the world of fully automatic espresso machines:

Per your experience, which milk frothing method is the best in terms of easy maintenance/cleaning ?

Among these options:

1. Automatic Milk Foamer - with a tube.  
The tube should be placed into some container (e.g. milk carton) that has milk.
2. Milk Carafe - external device (which looks like milk pitcher) that attaches directly to the espresso machine.
3. LatteGo Milk Cup

&amp;#x200B;

The seller told me that the tube thing (#1 option above) is getting cleaned automatically by the machine.  
But as far as I understand, that stuff should be disassembled and cleaned manually every few days, so it's relatively daunting.",Auto espresso machines - Best milk frothing option for easy maintenance,"Hi,

I ended up buying a Tassimo pod machine for £40 lol. The taste (costa vanilla latte pods) isn't terrible, I can drink it and it's an okay substitute to buying a Costa everyday at the moment, however it doesn't taste anything like a Costa (my original goal). It doesn't even taste remotely close to the Costa Express machines here in the UK. The one good thing is that it is very convenient, but all in all I am disappointed and I can only see myself reverting back to spending £3.50+ everyday at Costa in months to come - Something I would like to avoid. 

Having seen the error of my ways, I've taken on board some of the advice in my previous post and also done more research, I am now looking to spend more money and get a fully automatic machine, somthing like a De'Longhi ECAM with milk container attachment. I plan to buy the Costa Coffee beans and monin vanilla syrup to make my vanilla lattes. I've got a budget between £300 - £400 so any other recommendations would be great.

I'm a huge fan of the Japanese pour over ice coffee method.

I usually make it with a Clever Dripper and larger, whiskey ice cubes. This is partly because they're the only ice cubes we have, and because I like how they melt or don't.

I do around 23-26g of coffee, 8oz hot water, 8oz ice. I usually just let the coffee chill in the Clever for four minutes and drop it onto the ice. Nearly perfect iced coffee every time (to my tastes).

But! I figured I'd ask if anyone else here has a different method or technique they enjoy? It's always good to switch it up a bit and experiment!

1417,Coffee,"Hey everyone...

Just thought I'd share a story and hopefully serve as a reminder to handle your glass french press with a bit of caution when cleaning.

12 weeks ago I was cleaning out my Bodum Chambord like I'd done many times before. The old coffee grounds in the bottom were stuck, so I decided to give it a hard shake (up and down, not left to right) to get them loose. I wasn't *intending* to hit it against anything, just a (what I thought) faster way to get the grounds out.

On the downward motion of the shake, the glass connected with the edge of the trash can, shattered, and punctured into the base of my thumb. I could tell it went pretty deep because my hand was pushing *down* as the glass broke. I'll spare you all the gory details unless someone is interested... not trying to freak anyone out.

My 3 year old, right beside me, didn't notice a thing, and continued playing with his toys (thank goodness all of the glass landed in the trash can). I rushed downstairs, and went into a complete panic attack to my wife as I realized.... I couldn't wiggle my thumb. The base of my thumb could move, but the joint closer to the nail wouldn't bend whatsoever.

After 7 hours in the ER (which included multiple lidocaine shots and them looking for glass), and meetings with specialists, it was determined that I had severed my thumb's Flexor Pollices Longus tendon (FPL for short, it's basically in charge of bending your thumb)  and needed surgery to tie it back together.   

It's been 12 weeks since the surgery. I spent 2 weeks in a cast, and have done 10 weeks of rehabilitation work to get strength in my thumb back. I'm back to *functional* use of my thumb, although there's been some adjustments since I only have about a quarter of the movement I had previously.

Anyway, that's my little story about my Bodum Chambord incident. I *did* purchase a metal french press  and used it for a short bit of time (I was kinda nervous around glass for a bit), but I've since reverted to the Chambord.

Be safe and take the time to clean things properly!

I just got myself an aeropress (the mini version if that matters) and a moka pot to play around with in addition to my french press, and I'm looking for a grinder that can comfortably fit those different size requirements (I've been buying pre-ground beans until this point so this is from ground zero).

I can probably go up to 90-100 USD max but I am a broke college student so cheaper would definitely be better, I am very ok with it being a hand grinder so I hope I can squeeze in some extra quality there.

I have a few questions

1) there is a fine plastic mesh filter present. Should I still get the paper filters? Are there any reusable ones which are good?

1495,Coffee,"Hello coffee people.   


I've been using 1zpresso Q2 for a few months now. I usually grind something like 14 grams of coffee once a day and it takes me around 30 seconds to do it. I'm pretty happy with the grind with my only complain being that it is a bit slippery and small which I kinda fixed with a thick rubber band around the body of it. 

  
That said, i've been having some weird kuckle/finger pain that can't seem to go away and it is strangely only on my left hand which is the hand I use to rotate the handle with. The pain is somewhere between the index and middle finger - exactly where the wooden ball of the handle seems to fall. 

I have been trying to figure out if it is the grinder leads to this pain but I really can't come to a conclusion. I've had a Hario Skerton before which took literally 2 minutes to grind the same amount and never had any pain so i'm not sure if some mild 30 seconds grinding per day can lead to something like that

I'm fairly sporty - meaning that I exercise regulary so there might be a chance that this is also a result of pull ups or dumbell curls (have been trying to cut them for a while now).

1538,Coffee,"This is more a thought for a home brewer who drinks one cup (or few) per day, rather than a coffee shop that can ""dial things in"" daily.

Putting aside minor technicalities, and regardless of what your variables are (grind size, roast level, water temp, etc...), shouldn't we be able to get perfect extraction every brew by controlling the steep time? 

If that's the case, wouldn't a French Press be the best, most flexible way to ensure you get perfect extraction, each time, with any coffee? 

Its strange to me that pretty much every French Press recipe that you see gives some vague, arbitrary, guideline like ""let it steep for 4 minutes"". But, unlike with pretty much every other method, a French press should make it easy to pour out just a bit of coffee at different intervals to do a taste test. When the extraction is to your liking, fully plunge it (or re-plunge it) and pour it out into a thermos or whatever. 

Is there anything about this that is wrong? The only thing I can think of is that the flavor changes (if well-brewed, it improves) as the coffee cools, meaning this might be completely pointless and we're back at square one - iteratively finding a good recipe for each bean, which can be done with any brewing method.",French Press for perfect extraction on every brew?,"This is more a thought for a home brewer who drinks one cup (or few) per day, rather than a coffee shop that can ""dial things in"" daily.

The inner burr is perfectly fine, but the outer burr shows indents left from the edge of the inner one, as can be seen in the following pics: https://imgur.com/a/OXdIeRN

Thanks in advance!","JX-Pro, damaged outer burr","Hello everyone. The grinder fell off my hands while brushing it, and the inner burr lodged itself inside the outer burr, it was ~1-1.5mm at most stuck up inside the outer burr, and it was enough to require hammering it from the end where the handle attaches in order to dislodge it.

The inner burr is perfectly fine, but the outer burr shows indents left from the edge of the inner one, as can be seen in the following pics: https://imgur.com/a/OXdIeRN

1592,Coffee,"I'll start by saying that I was initially in the market for an espresso machine and almost settled on the Sage Bambino Plus. Then I started looking at grinders and saw the Niche Zero and quickly realised that what I wanted was going to be very expensive.

Although I love the flat white option that machine gave me, I pretty much always drink and enjoy a black coffee at home, so why not explore coffee brewers? I am too tired in the mornings and too busy during the day to make myself a flat white so will want a quick and no-fuss drink most of the time.

When looking for brewers I settled on the Sage Precision Brewer and either the Kinu M47 or the Comandante C40 to go with this (manual to save space in my not very large kitchen).

1594,Coffee,"Thumbs down for me.  


First, I did not find a coffee, that I had brewed 8 days in a row with a Kalita Wave 185 glass, better when brewing with Stagg X.  My first Stagg X brew was the same - I am certain I would not be able to blindly tell you which was which between it and Kalita Wave brews. The other Stagg X brew was a little more bitter than the Kalita brews which never had bitterness.  


Coffee would have to be noticeably better for me to want to use the Stagg X because in my experiences it is much more cumbersome. Perhaps these are only my negatives and others do not have them, or overcame them.  


Negatives for me:  


1) Size - too small for consistent brewing for medium to large pour-over brews.  


25g of coffee is pushing it, and is either its limit or above its limit. I can easily do a two pour after bloom method with a Kalita Wave 185 and a 02 V60.  With a Stagg X one would have to do three pours and that is to very top and almost full draw-down between them.    


That opens brews up to inconsistency in my view and harder to control kettle temperature.  I keep my kettle temperature at 209F for my Kalita and V60 brews.  It is easy to do, even using a stove as heating source, since the workflow of two pours is so consistent with both - I know exactly when to place and remove  the kettle with consistent timing of my pours with both.  This opens up the Stagg X brews to inconsistency and gives away its heat retention advantage since the kettle temperature is harder to control.   


2) More involved work flow - small size makes the funnel necessary for pour coffee grinds into it.  


Having to use the funnel to put your grind into it is awkward to me.  You have to remember to place the funnel over it before taring you scale, or your measurement of beans would be off.  You could weigh your coffee grinds first but some of the grind will likely stick to the container holding your ground beans so that would not be accurate for the grinds in your brew.  


3) Folds of filter compress inconsistently likely causing inconsistent brews.  


(I used Kalita Wave 185 filters in it, perhaps the more expensive and thicker Stagg filters would not do this.)   When pre-heating/rinsing it before brewing, some of the folds of the filter collapse. Sometimes one, sometimes more.  This leads to a inconsistent inner area.  I guess you could press all of them down for consistency, but that would be very involved, making the workflow even more complicated.   


4) Small size makes spinning between pours or at end (i.e. the Rao spin) hard to do.  


With its small size, and faster drain, it is very hard for me to do a spin between pours as thee water is near the top and will slosh over the sides of the filter causing massive by-pass and possibly putting grind grit into the brewed coffee. Not being able to spin, likely lowers extraction and increases risk of channeling.   


5) Does not fit regular carafes well.    


When I placed it on my Hario carafe, I could tell it would not work because it made a perfect seal around the carafes lips lower than the spout so there would have been a vacuum issue pushing against the exiting water from the brew, so I had to improvise placing the Stagg X into an empty V60 02 and then placing that setup on the carafe.   So in using the Stagg X one would have to improvise as I did which would make it more cumbersome, or get the Stagg carafe which is expensive and from reviews did not sit level every time, or get some kind of brace, like the V60 olivewood brace, to use it with other carafes easily.",Stagg X review,"Thumbs down for me.

sidenote- sorry if my usage of the word “roast” is incorrect. from my understanding it’s almost interchangeable with the word flavor (?)Lighter Roasts to try for someone new?"

&amp;#x200B;

Longer Story &amp; Background: I'm not sure when it happened, but I decided I wanted to drink better coffee. My first purchase was an Aeropress followed by getting my first manual grinder, a Handground Precision Coffee Grinder. For whatever odd reason, I didn't bother to look up reviews and just purchased on a whim. I guess it worked okay, but this past April 2021 I noticed that my grinder was making a weird scratching sound. The edge of the spring was catching on the axle. At some point it dug in, and I couldn't grind anymore. I got mad and ended up stripping the gears real bad inside the head assembly when I forced it. Foul language ensued.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been without a hand grinder since then, and when I need to grind beans I've been using a South East Asian style stone mortar and pestle. It works okay, but I don't want to use a mortar and pestle to grind beans anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing some research when I just discovered two things: 1. this subreddit and 2. James Hoffman. After some Youtube reviews and reading this subreddit, I settled on a 1Zpresso JX-Pro (arriving middle of next week). While I wait, I was wondering about some other upgrades or choices I can make. I already have an Aeropress and a French Press (an awful to clean Brazilian Bodum).

* Should I buy a Chemex?
   * One of the odder points of concern for me isn't the amount of fussiness or accuracy &amp; precision needed to make a great cup of coffee with this thing, but how well does this travel?

I'm also torn as to whether or not I should go for the 6 or 8 cup, and whether I should buy from a local shop or Amazon.
* How important is a gooseneck kettle?
   * I have a ""normal"" kettle, but it seems everybody uses a gooseneck. I'm looking at the Hario Gooseneck Buono, and it looks like it's a crapshoot if you get one that is either made in China or Japan if you purchase from Amazon.

This is my first post on this subreddit, and I’m hoping to get some advice on a new Moka pot to purchase. 

I was recently recommended Moka pot coffee by a friend and I saw one at TJ Maxx for $12 so I went for it. Turns out, it makes amazing coffee. I love it and my husband, who has never enjoyed home brew coffee, also loves it. We have used this pot twice a day for the last 1.5 months and since it was not particularly durable to begin with, now the gasket has stretched out and thinned to the point where it’s leaking. 

Since we’re such huge fans, we are ready to invest in a higher quality contraption and I’m wondering whether I should just stick with the classic Bialetti aluminum, get a stainless steel Moka pot, or try a pot where the bottom is stainless and the top is glass (which is admittedly tempting because seeing it brew would be helpful).

I really want to get into espresso, however as I drink it pretty frequently but am having to spend $5-6 every other day at the local cafe, and know I would be using my machine most likely 1-2 times a day if I got one. I would be making a range of things from espresso to milk based drinks like lattes, though I think milk based drinks more often atm.

I have been looking and researching espresso + grinder setups here and elsewhere and I have currently settled on the setup of the Lelit Elizabeth Double Boiler and the Eureka Mignon Specialita for the grinder. I had gone over many different options from the Gaggia Classic Pro + Sette 270, Silvia, and more but after much thought I've come to the conclusion that I'd rather spend the extra money to get a nice setup now instead of having to replace my average/middling setup with the same equipment later. With this in mind, I think the Elizabeth + Specialata combo really is an amazing bang for your buck while also being in the range where upgrades in the future would in the realm of diminishing returns compared to a substantial improvement in quality.

My questions really come down to a few things, firstly, what are your thoughts on this setup? Money really isn't an issue and these are certainly in budget, but I think this price range is a good happy medium that I want to settle in (~$2000-$2500). Are there any alternatives you think I should consider? If you own any of these two machines, how have your experiences been with them to date?

Overall, I think this price point is an area where I can really do no wrong and the big differences are features, quality of life, etc, and much less the taste between machines. They should easily pay for themselves in their lifetime so I have no doubts about getting a setup like this but was just seeking advice on if I am making a wise decision with this combo and just checking on alternatives before finally making the big splash.

Any help, advice, or just commentary would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!","[Gear, Question] Lelit Elizabeth + Eureka Mignon Specialita or Alternatives","Hello all here on r/coffee!

1670,Coffee,"I am racking my brain on what to do about my Moka Pot, and hoping someone can offer some clarity. I’ll try to be as specific as possible.

I am following the wonderful Moka Pot Reddit master guide and using: 

- 6-cup Bialetti aluminum.  
- Ethiopian Happy Mug coffee (roasted 6 days ago)
- 300g of Filtered water, poured into the base at 100c
- 30g of coffee ground on my Baratza Encore (setting 8-10)
- Electric stove on medium-medium high heat 
- Coffee begins to pour at 5:30-6:00 minutes, finished by 7 minutes or so
- Remove from heat and cooled down at first bubbling 

Here’s my issue. When I first received the coffee, I was grinding at a 4. For reference, nothing comes out of my Encore at setting 3. So 4 is the finest I can go. For some reason we loved the coffee at a level 4 on medium-high heat the one time, then after that I couldn’t recreate it. 

So now at a level 10, it tastes bitter, but at an 8 it doesn’t have much of a taste at all. 9 tastes a bit better but not like it did that first day at a 4. 

I’m confused and need some help. Thank you for your insights!","Seeking Moka Pot Dialing-In Help, Please!","I am racking my brain on what to do about my Moka Pot, and hoping someone can offer some clarity. I’ll try to be as specific as possible.

I've used the original Japanese filters for a long time, mostly by convinced by the great Hoff that these are best, but recently got some of the new Dutch filters to try. These new ones take quite a bit longer for the water to pass - longer draw-down. [Here's the pictures](https://imgur.com/a/wSsSdq8) to clarify which ones I'm talking about.

While trying them both with varying grind settings, the Japanese filters result in quicker brew ~2:30, flavor ranging from robust and dull on the fine side, sweet spot between, to thin on the coarse end. With the Dutch filter the draw-down is a minute or so longer. Flavor ranges in similar way, but it seems grind size is more forgiving to get a good cup, and I'm getting more crisp and balanced cup when I get the grind setting on point. Also the ideal grind size is somewhat coarser on these papers compared to the Japanese ones.

I'm just curious at this point as many people tend to hate on the new filters and favor this short brew with the fast japanese filter. Maybe I'm missing something? I also brew and enjoy coffee with my Chemex, so maybe I'm the odd one.

I have no problem with the basket and the lid. (Major point of complaint in Amazon reviews.) You take off the basket, you put it in the sink. You screw on the lid. What's the big deal? I like the carafe - keeps coffee hot for the half hour or so between cups. I don't like to hold coffee for much longer, even if it's at a hot temperature.  

The other big complaint is that there's a tiny amount of liquid you can't get out of the carafe. So, you take a paper towel and wipe the inside Again, no biggie.

I have no problem with the basket and the lid. (Major point of complaint in Amazon reviews.) You take off the basket, you put it in the sink. You screw on the lid. What's the big deal? I like the carafe - keeps coffee hot for the half hour or so between cups. I don't like to hold coffee for much longer, even if it's at a hot temperature.  

The other big complaint is that there's a tiny amount of liquid you can't get out of the carafe. So, you take a paper towel and wipe the inside Again, no biggie.

All that said, looking for ratios from people who have them and like them. Maybe I'm missing something. Bonavita recommends 10g per 5 ounces of water.Finally got myself a Bonavita BTS-1900"
1710,Coffee,"I recently found out about dry processed coffee from a James Hoffmann video, I read that a lot of people aren't into it but it really peaked my interest.

Buy was I wrong, I checked out a few stores locally. Besides big brands there are 4 local small roasters that also sell their coffee through local stores.

1724,Coffee,"Was looking for a travel hand grinder that performs decently enough for good Aeropress or drip, and would be a backup for espresso at home if my ROK isn't working for some reason.  It appears that these two look close enough to maybe be the classic Amazon thing with the same factory cranking out the same product with 2 different looks, for very different price points.

Figured I might as well get something that fits into the plunger of my Aeropress because that makes it just a bit more likely I'd sometimes be able to make room for a great cup of coffee when backpacking.

It looks like it's nearly identical to the 1Zpresso Q2.

1. I can't try the JM38 out and still return it so I'm wondering - has anyone used it and figured if it's a good enough value to keep despite the larger footprint when packing? 
2. Is the Q2 worth the $40 upgrade and does it actually slide easily into the plunger?  All the looking I did suggests it's the most versatile, fastest, and highest quality grinder that packs as well as it does.  Anybody used both?

So I recently discovered the 4:6 method and I was getting really solid results from it at home over the summer. Summer ended and I'm back at work so I figured I would continue to get great cups here.

Unfortunately, I've had really hit or miss (although mostly miss) results at work. At first I figured it was my grinder (I have a Solis Scala at work and an OE Lido E at home). The Scala was producing a lot of fines even on the coarsest setting and I was getting brew times of over 4 minutes. I figured bringing the OE to work would remedy the problem, but I'm still struggling. One of my beans, Verve Guji, has resulted in some decent cups with the OE at school, but I cannot get a decent cup out of my Peach Roasters Guji.

I'm grinding the same as at home, using the same recipe (4:6 method with 20g coffee to 300g water, 198F water temp, 5 even pours of 60g). My only variable is my water which I am getting from the water bottle filling station here at work instead of my tap (and sometimes my Brita) at home. 

To be fair, I haven't tried the Peach Guji at home since I just bought the bag a few days ago to keep at work, but it is weird to me that I cannot get a good cup out of it. It keeps coming out sour without any of the complex or sweet flavors one would expect out of an Ethiopian.

Is it possible that the 4:6 method just doesn't work well for certain beans? I used to use the Hoffman method, but the simplicity of the 4:6 enticed me as I could just pre-weigh my 20g and not have to think too much when making a cup between work tasks.

1749,Coffee,"Hi team,

I've been researching grinders, and have realized that most of the ""budget but still legit"" burr grinders lack a timer feature.  There are indeed affordable conical ""burr"" grinders with timers out there in the $50 - $100 range, but having researched around this sub, it seems that you have to be careful in avoiding ""faux burr"" grinders--so I'm not really sure how to tell whether a given grinder is ""legit"" on my own!

Whenever the topic of burr grinders for beginners pops up, the budget option is usually around $100 and lacks a timer (for example, the Baratza Encore), and the ""step up"" option usually does include a timer but is around $250 (for example, the Breville BCG820BSS, or the Baratza Virtuoso+).

So I guess I'm wondering if there are any ""legit"" burr grinders somewhere between those two price points that does indeed include a timer feature?  Let's say I'm happy with the grind quality of one of those $100-ish ""entry level but legit"" grinders but am willing to pay a bit more for something with a timer, but don't feel the need to step up to one of the $250-ish grinders?

And if there's any way to tell whether a given grinder is ""faux burr"" or ""legit burr"" from reading product descriptions, I'd love to know that as well so that I can more effectively continue researching grinders on my own!

Thanks!",Affordable conical burr grinder with timer?,"Hi team,

I've been researching grinders, and have realized that most of the ""budget but still legit"" burr grinders lack a timer feature.  There are indeed affordable conical ""burr"" grinders with timers out there in the $50 - $100 range, but having researched around this sub, it seems that you have to be careful in avoiding ""faux burr"" grinders--so I'm not really sure how to tell whether a given grinder is ""legit"" on my own!

Whenever the topic of burr grinders for beginners pops up, the budget option is usually around $100 and lacks a timer (for example, the Baratza Encore), and the ""step up"" option usually does include a timer but is around $250 (for example, the Breville BCG820BSS, or the Baratza Virtuoso+).

So I guess I'm wondering if there are any ""legit"" burr grinders somewhere between those two price points that does indeed include a timer feature?  Let's say I'm happy with the grind quality of one of those $100-ish ""entry level but legit"" grinders but am willing to pay a bit more for something with a timer, but don't feel the need to step up to one of the $250-ish grinders?

And if there's any way to tell whether a given grinder is ""faux burr"" or ""legit burr"" from reading product descriptions, I'd love to know that as well so that I can more effectively continue researching grinders on my own!

Looking for some advice. Living in melbourne i'm a lover of everything coffee, but with covid for the last 2 years I've been working from home.

I've been trying all different beans and even have a coffee bean subscription. 

I Normally drink a long black and my wife has a latte.

We have minimal bench space so have a delonghi dedica EC 680, which is paired with a Breville bcg450 Grinder. 
We keep our beans in an airtight  fellow Atmos container and grind daily when we make a coffee.
I recently also changed to a non pressurized portafilter.

My coffee has improved significantly after changing.

Thinking of upgrading to The Gaggia classic - although this would take up more benchspace or the Breville Barista Pro, which would mean I could get rid of my grinder.

I have some questions:
1) which one would be recommended between the two, should I even upgrade?
2) what would be the pros and cons? Including space?
3) what are your key tips and experience points that could help me
4) option that I should consider my budget is maybe 600 Australian dollars

If it feels like your coffee's flavor has degraded, but your grinder still seems to work fine, have a look at the upper ring burr, specifically 3 little plastic flanges around the outside edge. These are very thin bits of plastic, I have no idea how they break, but if any of them do break, your upper burr won't ""lay"" correctly with your cone burr, it will push up off-axis where the flange is missing, meaning you'll be grinding both coarse and fine at the same time.  One way to tell this visually is if your bean hopper appears to be ""rocking"" slightly about 1mm up or down during grinding. Another is if you start seeing large chunks of coffee after brewing.

See this video [https://youtu.be/DhmAEZmgGvY?t=16](https://youtu.be/DhmAEZmgGvY?t=16) for a picture of the part, a good one next to a bad one.

1803,Coffee,"Hi guys, i'm pretty new with the hand grinder.  
Recently i bought one from aliexpress just for try the thing out but I find my self really confused by the clicks and so.  
 stupidly  i dissambled the grinder without give too much focus to the initial position and now i think that there is something wrong with the position of the component.

In the manual there is written that for a pour over i should grind with a setting of 28 clicks, but it seems too coarse (usually i make grind my beans in a coffee shop)  
[Images of the grinder, maybe somebody have the same and the ground after the pour over with what i count 28 clicks.](https://imgur.com/a/jXtF805)  
In the knob setting there are some numbers but i don't have any clue to what they indicate bicause are in a circle from 0 to 12 and the first click start at 3 o 4.  
Anyway, i guess empirically i can find the right setting that i need, but there is some way for allign the numbers with the clicks? Or usually the clicks are always counted from 0 setting? (so the numbers are there just for confuse me?)

1813,Coffee,"The instruction manual has the following line highlighted:

""For precise adjustments, always adjust grind size while grinding coffee. Keeping some coffee in the hopper, while in operation, will greatly improve the consistency and repeatability of your results.""

I don't understand what this means. Is it saying that, when I want to change the grind setting, I should start grinding at the old setting then change it mid-grind? I'd get two different grind sizes.

The second sentence is also confusing me. What does it mean by ""keeping some coffee in the hopper, during operation""? There's obviously coffee in the hopper during operation, because I'm grinding it, so that can't be what it means. Does it mean I should leave some in after I finish grinding?

Mostly automatic drip, pourover in a V60 and a Chemex as well as Aeropress, French Press and from time to time a vacuum siphon.  I am hard pressed to think that the Baratza would be that big of an improvement over the Bodum.Grinder Upgrade Time?"

1849,Coffee,"My JX-Pro, which I've had for about a year, has just started having this issue where after disassembly, when screwing the dial on and attempting to zero, the thumb nut and burr shaft will ""slip"" off the dial threading and reset after just a few rotations, making it impossible to tighten and therefore use the grinder. I've deep cleaned the dial to make sure there aren't any oils or fines or anything else stopping the thumb nut and the dial from playing nice together, which seems to have helped since there is now less resistance when approaching the point in which the nut slips off, but it still does not stop slipping. I've inspected the dial itself and it looks like the threading may be damaged in one spot towards the bottom of the dial, which makes sense considering it always slips in the same spot.

1877,Coffee,"Hello! Youtube suggested a lovely video made by a charming gentleman showing how italians make coffee using a moka pot to me, and I noticed a few common mistakes people make. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scQncAeB_20

I quite liked the video and this is nothing personal against Mr. Contaldo, I simply think it might be helpful for people who are trying to make a better coffee with this method. I want to point out just the moka pot specific issues, you can also compare this video to the one made by James Hoffmann.

Firstly, the moka pot is dirty. The ""patina"" myth has been discussed many times. There is nothing good about rancid oils. Maintaining your moka pot clean will make your better, especially if you want to taste different notes of the different kinds of coffee you buy. And also it is safer.

Secondly, Mr. Contaldo is putting too much water in the tank. This is a big problem. Why? Because there is not enough space for the gas to expand to push the water upwards and instead of going smoothly through the coffee beans into the top chamber, there is going to be a great deal of gargling and sputtering, the pot will struggle to fill the upper chamber to more than a half. It will lead to overextraction and simply put ruining your brew. You can see this at 3:00.

This brings us to the third point. The overfilling is not only a problem because of making a poor cup of coffee, it's also a problem because you will end up often needing to have the pot on high heat with very little water inside the bottom chamber, which will lead to damage and corrosion of your moka pot if that happens often.

And this leads us to the last point. Mr Contaldo's moka pot is broken. What you see at 2:54 is not supposed to happen. The overfilling already led to the damage of the moka pot and the safety valve no longer seals the bottom chamber, which leads to intensification of the issues in the second point. It's a bit of a vicious circle. This moka pot will never have enough pressure to prepare a proper cup of coffee. If there would be too much pressure in the moka pot, the gas would leak through the middle of the safety valve, not around it. I do not consider this moka pot safe to use, although I assume it's better to have a leaking safety valve than a clogged one.",A few mistakes to avoid when brewing with a moka pot,"Hello!

Our Saeco Aroma of many years is starting to show signs of age, such as water leaking from the wand when brewing, so I started looking for a replacement, and possibly upgrade. I've spent the last couple of weeks sifting through reviews and, while I learnt a lot, I'm more confused on what to choose than when I started. That's when I realized that surely there is a reddit community that can help!  


We typically have 2 cappuccinos/lattes in the morning, 2 espressos after lunch, 1 espresso in the evening. Usually, one lunch and the evening shot are decaf. 

Some parameters for the search:

Dear coffee experts, any thoughts on these machines? Are there any other brands/models you would suggest instead?

Thanks!",need help selecting the perfect espresso machine for me,"First time poster here, so please be gentle :-)

Our Saeco Aroma of many years is starting to show signs of age, such as water leaking from the wand when brewing, so I started looking for a replacement, and possibly upgrade. I've spent the last couple of weeks sifting through reviews and, while I learnt a lot, I'm more confused on what to choose than when I started. That's when I realized that surely there is a reddit community that can help!  


We typically have 2 cappuccinos/lattes in the morning, 2 espressos after lunch, 1 espresso in the evening. Usually, one lunch and the evening shot are decaf.

The price seemed reasonable if someone wanted to liquidate their stock and website didn't look too sketchy; about on par with some random roaster's websites I've seen in the past. I was about to buy from them when I noticed that another piece of equipment I was interested in was ALSO on sale! This made me go through all of their equipment... and it started to seem fishy considering everything was below typical prices.

I ended up searching their listed address, which resulted in nothing, just a random warehouse on street view.

The only concrete evidence I could find was Baratza's website, which listed NON-authorized dealers, which included this particular site. I feel fortunate that I was able to verify not to put my information into this site, but I was surprisingly close to falling for it.

The last few weeks have been brutal (after buying my first grinder), nothing tasted good, it was either super bitter, empty, weak, terrible. I was tempted to buy a french-press or V60, thinking something was very wrong with my setup, since I tried lots and lots of things. Almost everything from 1:10 to 1:20, super fine, super coarse grind sizes, different filters, folding the filter differently, different pouring techniques, oh boy, nothing seemed to work.

Today I decided to keep my water temperature at 90~92c and my god, I finally got a slightly bitter, just a tad weak coffe in my hands. 12g of coffee for 180ml of filtered water. Poured 50g + 50g then 80g (didn't time it, just waited for it to go through).

Sorry if this has been addressed before - I'm new to this subreddit (and Reddit in general), but I recently bought a Keurig and have been trying lots of different k-cups.

1945,Coffee,"People think of Portland, Oregon as having a strong barista culture. But that is probably a misguided assumption. Yes, there are a number of third-wave coffee places, some quite famous like Albina Press and Stumptown, and then a number of smaller coffee entrepreneurs whose product is of varying quality. Part of that is because food trucks here are very cheap to permit, which has led to a lot of entrepreneurship in mobile food trucks.

Near my home there are two separate coffee food trucks, both of which have an espresso machine and make espresso drinks. Yes, their menus include a lot of frou-frou, sweet drinks, but I didn't think that was a red flag; I assumed, naively, that a cappuccino was a simple enough ask, even though neither had it explicitly on their menus. Yet on two separate occasions, at both of these carts, when I ordered one I was asked if I wanted a ""16 ounce, 24 ounce or 32 ounce"". 

This was very confusing to me. I thought a cappuccino was, by nature, small -- maybe a shot or two of espresso and equal volumes milk and foam. 8 ounces ideally, perhaps 12 in a rare case. I thought this was a really normal drink and it was, by nature, a small thing to behold. Isn't the point of a cappuccino that it is small and concentrated? 

Both baristas were confused when I said the cappuccino could be 8 ounces and it would be fine. In both cases I was given a full sixteen-ounce cup that contained what, as far as I could tell, was a latte with no foam — espresso that had been extremely diluted with warm milk. 

I did not want to sound snobby, so I didn't push it. But I also felt like this was coffee 101; and as I stared down at this big latte I started to wonder if I were being gaslit or something.

I am trying to figure out if I am the idiot, or if there is such thing as a ""32 ounce cappuccino."" Is that not just a huge latte? What does it even mean to make a cappuccino big?

1985,Coffee,"Just got the J-Max today and straight out of the box I have to say I'm super disappointed :(.

Firstly, the burr was blocked shut (despite following the steps exactly as in the manual to set the zero point and then opening the burr) and I had to gently force it out by pressing down on top of the axle pretty hard. Hope the burr isn't damaged.

Secondly, I followed the instructions to disassemble it and clean it before use and found lots of excess grease and more worryingly lots of tiny shards of metal around the burr. If I hadn't done this then no doubt I would have drunk some of that, which is pretty shitty when so much aluminium is involved...

I know this is a 'cheaper' high end grinder, but the production quality and this kind of mess is really shitty for over €200! No excuses

1992,Coffee,"I'm in a market for a stovetop kettle with a thermometer. Since the  Hario Buono thermometer is rather pricey and often out of stock, I think the Smart G kettle is my best bet.

1994,Coffee,"Hey all, 

As it says I have a trial shift in a cafe soon and I was looking for any last minute handy tips you guys might have for operating the coffee machine as it’s been about 5 years since I last used one. They seem pretty nice there and I’ll be shown some stuff but nothing negative about coming in a little prepared. Going to do some of my own research over the next couple hours (late, I know)

Many thanks in advance!

1996,Coffee,"Hi all! My last nanopresso post got taken down (idrk why) so this is a truncated repost of the technique I use with my nanopresso to make pretty decent coffee.

Considerations that went into buying a nanopresso:

1. I need a ton of caffeine and sipping a thermos full of french pressed coffee/ filter coffee in the morning just isn't a fast enough route of caffeine in the morning.
2. Hot water is easily available where I'm at
3. Wanted to have something that can brew pods/ pack grounds easily. Mainly for ease of use when out and about.
4. I'm can't afford a proper machine.

Without further ado, here are the tips:

1. The nanopresso really struggles to get a good brew with lighter roasts. I recommend learning the device using a a dark or medium-dark roast first, before attempting lighter roasts.
2. Grind fine, but not too fine. 9-11 clicks on my timemore c2 work just fine.
3. Using the barista kit basket, aim to fill only around 14g (+/- 1g). It's a pain to fill, so what I did was i got a silicon funnel and snipped off the end so that it fits nicely onto the basket. Saves a lot of time and effort trying to manually fill the basket.
4. Currently I brew 14g in, 40g out. A bit weak I know but I quite like the results as compared to the traditional 2:1 ratio. You can always push a bit more water through or cut the shot early depending on your beans so this is just a general ballpark reference figure that I start with then adjust from.
5. Use the small water tank and the barista kit basket. Realised that by using this setup, I'd run out of water just nicely around the 40g mark.
6. Preheat preheat preheat! I always take water fresh off the boil, fill the small and pump 10-20 pumps into the cup. With the above setup, I'd then be able to rest my nanopresso in the cup upside down with the nozzle in the cup so that the heat in the cup helps to warm up the portafilter as well. I'd leave it like that for at least 30s. Take this time to cleanup and preheat your cups as well if you're using separate cups.
7. Assembly. I tend to put my grounds in before screwing on the water chamber just so that I minimise the time (and heat loss) from the water once it's out of the kettle (I use a temp controlled kettle that gives me a readout of the temperature and allows me to manually control the temperature of the water inside.)
8. Temperature. The nanopresso sucks heat from your water. Using a water thermometer, my measurement was about 5 degrees are lost in the process of transferring and assembling. I measured the water in the kettle, water in the water chamber pre-assembling and water in the ?brew chamber and that's how I arrived at the 5 degrees lost. Thus, it's ESSENTIAL that you add 5 degrees to whatever brew temp you are used to brewing that particular coffee in and adjust from there.
9. Preinfusion. What this means is I'd pump quickly about 10 times to build pressure, and around then the first drop should come out. Once it's out, stop pumping and just wait. (10s dark roasts, 20s medium, 30s for light). Then resume pumping. I've gotten pretty sweet shots with lighter roasts by changing the preinfusion time so it's worth a shot!
10. Pump speed. Again, change this based on your roast. For dark roasts, I do a 1:1 pump-rest ratio, pumping at a speed of 1 pump in 1 second. How I do it is count 'one thousand (during which I'd pump and release) two thousand (rest)...'. For medium roasts, it's a 1:2 pump-rest ratio i.e. 'one thousand (pump), two thousand (rest) three thousand (rest'. For light it's a 1:3 pump-rest ratio.
11. In theory, having a slower pump speed artificially increases the water contact time with the grounds, hence boosting extraction.
12. I couldn't really find anything online about pump speed, and this was just me messing around with a light roasted coffee to see how can I boost extraction. So far this method gives me good results.
13. A good flow rate is around 2g per pump. Any less and you'd probably have to grind coarser, any more and you'd have to grind finer. My advice when dialing in is to get the grind size right to get this flow rate, before adjusting other factors like temperature, preinfusion time and pump speed (as mentioned above)
14. Once you've finished your shot, immediately unscrew the filter and rinse it in water. In so doing I realise i get the least grounds stuck underneath the orange O-ring. Remove your basket, set it aside to cool a bit before tapping out.
15. Stir and sip (or add milk if you so choose).
