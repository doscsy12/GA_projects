25,tea,"I'm writing this post, because today I felt like I would explode, so beware the long text without meaning.

I know we are living some in some hard conditions now. I also know that the distance between me and the tea vendors is not exactly negligible. This is why I usually save some interesting teas that I really want to try and I only order once or twice a year, to minimize shipping costs (relative to the product) and other hassle. 

Well today I found out how little one person is in the schemes of capitalism and bureaucratic formations. I have ordered a ""small"" package from YS which may or may not had a value of $230. First slap was the lack of courier option, only air mail, which translates to Romanian post and that means waiting for more than a month (the price was nearly the same as using DHL from the last time). I was OK with this.   
I was even OK with the fact that I must pay VAT (9%) and some other duties (3% since the value is more than $150). 

The packet arrived at the customs office. I've received a message that I can get the packet, but I have to bring a transaction extract, which is expected. There they say that I can't have the package, because I have to write some import declaration, which can only be done at another facility which is twice as far as the customs office from me. Of course, everything is done in person, because we don't live in a year with pandemic, or we do not have PC-s and internet. After I go there sign what needs to be signed, pay what needs to be payed, I have to go back to the customs to prove it, and to get the package.Oh, did I mention that these nice fellas only work 3 days in a week, once 7 hours and twice 6 hours? And that after 3 work days they charge me extra for some sort of upkeep?

How the hell does a person who has a full-time job comply with the bullshits of a country?

Did I really make a mistake of having tea as a hobby? Or being born in a peasant-ass country as mine?

Are customs services in other countries the same?

I ordered this tea from YS after it was recommended when I reached out for suggestions. It is amazing! I don’t really like drinking it gong fu simply because I love the round robustness I get from western, I think this is generally how I feel about black teas anyway( let me know if you have a black tea that you feel gong fu does it true justice)

So as for flavor I have had it hot and cold and both have a great personality. 

Hot- first you get a nice light black tea flavor then a flash of cocoa (like good dark chocolate) that then fades to a nice mellow sweetness.

Cold- first off you get a nice robust mix of tea and tannins followed by the light sweetness from like the hot and then notes of raw cocoa. After you swallow the notes of cocoa take over and give you a full mouth flavor that reminds me of chewing cocoa nibs.

Overall this tea is an excellent buy and my 50g order was not nearly enough. With the rate me and my dad are drinking it I could see a 500g-1Kg order in the near future. Let me know what you guys think or any tips/comments you have :)",Black and gold Bi Lou Chun,"Another little tea review/ blog

* the Gyokuro Karigane. I have no experience with gyokuro teas. So far I only tasted some fukamushi sencha. This one was a flavor bomb too.

Do you heat your water in the microwave? Add milk to fruit or mint teas? Brew even white tea at boiling temperatures? Prepare matcha in a liquor shaker bottle? Never take your tea bag out of the mug? Reuse tea leaves until they mold??

112,tea,"I usually drink tea with large meals, but today I had a light meal and drank my usual Peppermint Tea. I got a huge headache that I could feel behind my eyes (more like a migraine) and then I had nausea. I was trying to ignore it but I ended up yakking (throwing up). Has this happened to anyone before?

118,tea,"Seems like everything that i drink besides earl grey and chai tastes like hot water to me. My friend got me into tea and I really want to be able to talk about it with them, but I’ve been struggling. 
Recently snagged some bags of loose leaf black teas from a ren faire merchant and their stuff smelled amazing! I was excited to try it. poured some hot water from my keurig over the tea leaves, let sit for 5 min, add a small bit of sugar and sipped. tasted like hot water. 

I thought it must have been steeped too little, so I put it in for another couple minutes, sipping occassionally. still tasted like hot water. Tried again a few days later with another thing of black tea and had the same effect. 

Am I brewing wrong? I feel like chai and earl grey only seem to have flavor because I dunk it with sugar and milk as my morning alt to coffee. I’m trying to start liking tea without milk and less sugar but it just doesn’t seem to work. Do… *all* black teas taste like hot water?? let me know if you can provide any info, i feel like im going nuts trying to figure out what i did wrong. All i wanted was a cup of tea lol

if it helps, im usually a ‘bold flavor’ person. I love any food or drink that hits me straight in the mouth with a burst of strong flavor. i feel like tea im getting might be too ‘subtle’? which sucks cause it smells amazing lol


tl;dr: i think im fucking up my tea because everything i brew tastes like hot water besides chai and earl grey. is it just me?",is it just my fault?,"Seems like everything that i drink besides earl grey and chai tastes like hot water to me.

A family member borrowed my Contigo stainless steel travel mug, brewed a cup of what I think was some kind of black tea, and then left it for at least a couple days before it got cleaned.

I don’t do tea, I’m a coffee drinker, but now everything I put it in the mug tastes absolutely bitter.

I’ve soaked and then scrubbed it with incredibly hot and soapy water.

I’m at a loss at what else to try. Help!","Need help cleaning a stainless steel travel mug that had tea left in it, everything has a bitter taste now","So basically the title.

128,tea,"Hi guys! long time lurker here. 

I've been looking to get into puerh recently, and started by researching the subject online. on the [brew guide page](https://yunnansourcing.com/pages/brewing-guide-for-green-black-oolong-and-pu-erh-teas) at Yunnan Sourcing i saw than they recommend  brewing oolong with water just off the boil, hotter than they recommend for black tea. they also recommend long wash times, in some cases 20 seconds (raw puerh).

I don't think I've ever seen a recommendation to brew lighter tea with hotter water. do you think this is a mistake (like switching black with Oolong), some idiosyncratic brewing method, or is this a thing?

I also have english breakfast and I'm planning on trying to make it with that instead.

166,tea,"Hello all, hope this is allowed. I’m trying to buy a new electric kettle (in the UK) and I have a very sensitive palate and I’m struggling to find one that doesn’t taste of plastic, even after trying all the taste tricks; boiling and reboiling, using bicarb, descaler, lemon juice and salt water etc. 
I don’t know if it’s a BPA issue, some companies state that they don’t use BPA plastics anywhere they would ‘come into contact’ with food/drink, but I’m not sure if that includes lids, and if so, I have no idea what it is I can taste. I would have thought a kettle containing no BPA plastics would lose that plastic taste after it’d been boiled 40-50 times. 

My last successful kettle was an all stainless steel Russell Hobbs (Model 23925) but they don’t make it any more, and it lacks a little anyway. I’ve tried two other Russell Hobbs kettles this week, the purity kettle with brita filter (which is plastic but I thought I’d give it a chance, it’s not too bad but I’m not a fan overall) and their stainless steel quiet boil kettle (which is lovely as a kettle except the taste which is awful and I just can’t resolve). 

I’m just wondering what kettles or kettle brands you’ve been successful with in the UK, for those with sensitive palates. I don’t mind general brand recommendations but there’s not much point recommending a model that’s been discontinued completely. Any recommendations I’ve been able to find have either been outdated or not available in the UK, or have been based on the description rather than experience. My dad swears by Phillips kettles for example, I’m just looking for some pointers as I’m about ready to give up on Russell Hobbs.

I just discovered this Subreddit and thought I would say hello 😊

Being from Ireland I was a tea drinker when I was younger. In Ireland there are two main brands - Lyons and Barrys. There is always a fierce debate about which is the more superior brand. It's Lyons for me. But when I was younger I always had milk in my tea, sometimes I put sugar in it sometimes I didn't.

Then I became a coffee drinker. I loved my Lattes, cappuccinos etc. Every so often I would give it up and go back to Tea but that would only last a couple of weeks. 

About 3 months ago after a period of ill health I gave up the Lattes and Cappuccinos and went back on the tea. And not the tea with milk. And I have to say I'm loving it. I adore green tea. Have tried Dandelion and Nettle which tastes like dirt but are enjoyable 😁. I've bought loose herbs to make my own tea. I recently tried Rooibos which I like and my next step is trying Pur Eh tea. I love the Pukka brand of teas and also Hearth and Heather. I discovered I prefer the earthy flavours rather than the fruity flavours. I've ran out of space for all my teas 😂

I recently bought a gorgeous silver plated teapot by Yeoman, does anyone know what kind of base metal Yeoman used? It's in mint condition on the outside, but recently when I let the tea stand for a little while, it tasted of rust and little black particles were in the tea. I'm a bit concerned now with regard to the safety of using it. Could it be pewter, copper or brass? Or something else? I used it a few times and it seemed fine, so this was only a recent thing. 

Near the little holes on the inside there seems to be a tiny about of silvery looking metal missing and it looks a bit like copper - is it cooper or rust, and would either of these things be of concern? Is it possible to restore it somehow? It really is a beauty, I don't want to use it as a vase...! I don't know its exact age, my guess is ca. 40s or 50s.

But I've noticed that when I use normal sugar, the sweetness is more focused on the front of my mouth. I have no idea if this is the case for others, but it's the case for me.  


Liking some sugar in most teas I drink, I decided to try putting some of both types in, and it was sort of a revelation on my end. The flavor of everything was a lot more well-rounded in my mouth than using either of the types of sugar.

I was wondering if other people have had a similar experience or if I'm just all alone in this.","Stevia + Normal sugar, anyone else tried this?","So, I'm not usually that big of a fan of stevia in anything, it hits the back of my mouth, then leaves an aftertaste there. But I've noticed that when I use normal sugar, the sweetness is more focused on the front of my mouth. I have no idea if this is the case for others, but it's the case for me.

251,tea,"I recently got a pretty decent sized order from YS and I’m going to right reviews on here as I try the teas,to help myself reflect and better understand tea and to provide an interesting read for anyone who likes a more in-depth read on a tea.


I have never had silver needle before or really any white tea but I was super excited for this one and ordered 100g- great decision

Ratios: 120ml useable space in my gaiwan- 5 grams of tea (will use 6 next time)- freshly boiled water

Taste and fragrance: after the wash it put off a wonderful smell of flowers and sweetness, I’d love a candle that smells like this wonderful tea. The first few steeps are light without to much body and a nice sweet undertone, very reminiscent of flower water? Once you get to the 3rd or 4th steep this tea starts to ramp up, the buds are open and ready. You get a very strong flowery nectar flavor for about two steeps that then fades to the background and allows the tea flavor to come forward. I kept the steeps under a minute at this point and it never grew astringent, just a very powerful tea flavor and then a wave of flower like sweetness.It’s mouth feel was thick but a little dry and left the after taste that I can best describe as a spring field. Later in- around 7 or 8 steeps- the sweetness slowly disappears and you get a nice full bodied white tea.

I would recommend this tea and will mostly likely serve to friends. It could be a very easy daily drink as it’s not to potent in any direction but it still carries its weight.

I usually just buy bottles of those Honest brand iced honey green teas (which is pretty good, not overly sweet), but I'm craving an above average quality hot ""raw"" tea. 

I heard tea bags are generally frowned upon in the tea community (for years I've drank Whole Foods green tea bags in those big 70-packs, I'm actually drinking some as I'm typing this out), and I've heard lukewarm/mixed reception on gunpowder tea (which seems to be a bit better quality than bagged tea, and is priced very low).

I like to drink *only unsweetened* tea if it's hot, I don't like to add additional flavors or sweeteners. I boil tea the ""rough"" way (I basically just bring water in a small stovetop pot to almost-boiling, around 180-190°F, and seep the tea for 5 minutes exactly), I don't have any fancy expensive tea kettle or anything.

Ok so after making my own tea pets I wanted to create a guide on how to DIY your own. The process is relatively inexpensive, somewhat messy, but super rewarding. With a bit of artistic talent and some gusto you can turn a handful of dry dirt into a beautiful little tea companion. This is in no way a perfect guide but it should have the basic info 

Tools
For clay gathering/sculpting: 
Metal mesh strainer 
2 buckets 
Some sort of cloth (I used an old bedsheet)
A baking pan or sheet 
Popsicle sticks or any other sculpting tools 

For firing: 
Metal pot with a lid 
Metal tongs (make sure they’re nice and long)
Scrap wood and any flammable materials 
Bricks, cinder blocks, or just flat stones 


Step 1: gathering the clay 

Yea you could probably just buy clay from your local craft store. But after the whole hobby lobby smuggling scheme I just decided to do it myself and not give money to those crazy fucks. 

1. Gather some dirt. Try to walk around and find a spot where the dirt is pale and cracked looking. Try looking around construction sites or places where the topsoil has been removed. Make sure to take out any plants or large debris 

2. Put the dry dirt in a bucket with water and mix it with your hands. Make sure to add roughly double the water as there is dirt. The trick here is that clay will remain suspended in water far longer than sand or gravel. Let the dirt soup sit for a bit and you’ll see the sand settle to the bottom 

3. Put the strainer on top of a bucket and carefully pour the dirt soup through it to strain out the gravel. If the strainer is fine enough the sand will also be strained through. 

4. The water should now be soley clay particles, if some sand remains try to filter it a few more times. 

5. Get a peice of fine fabric (I used a part of an old bedsheet) and put it over the opening of the empty second bucket. Pour the clay slurry into the cloth. It will take a long time to filter, so just let it sit for sound 2-3 hours. Once most of the water is gone simply wrap the rest of the cloth around the clay and hang it from a place off the ground so it can dry further. When the clay is no longer slimy it’s ready to use

Step 2: the fire

1. Sculpt the tea pets and let them fully dry for a day or more. The color should lighten. 
Put the tea pets in the oven and slowly raise the temperature. While they’re baking you can go outside and set up the fire. If you have a fire pit you can just use that, but since I don’t I just put an old metal pot on top of two bricks and started the fire inside that. 

2. If you have charcoal briquettes then go ahead and use those. If not, try to gather firewood or dry sticks. 

3. Once the fire gets going you can take the tea pets out of the oven and put them directly into the fire. The gradual heating up ensures they are fully dry before they are fired 

4. Keep adding fuel to the fire for as long as you desire. 

5. After 2 hours or so you can let the fire burn out. Wait at least 8 hours (or overnight) so the tea pets are fully cooled down and you don’t accidentally burn yourself 

6. Brush off the ashes and volia! Your teapets are done!

1. Gather some dirt. Try to walk around and find a spot where the dirt is pale and cracked looking. Try looking around construction sites or places where the topsoil has been removed. Make sure to take out any plants or large debris 

2. Put the dry dirt in a bucket with water and mix it with your hands. Make sure to add roughly double the water as there is dirt. The trick here is that clay will remain suspended in water far longer than sand or gravel. Let the dirt soup sit for a bit and you’ll see the sand settle to the bottom 

3. Put the strainer on top of a bucket and carefully pour the dirt soup through it to strain out the gravel. If the strainer is fine enough the sand will also be strained through. 

4. The water should now be soley clay particles, if some sand remains try to filter it a few more times. 

5. Get a peice of fine fabric (I used a part of an old bedsheet) and put it over the opening of the empty second bucket. Pour the clay slurry into the cloth. It will take a long time to filter, so just let it sit for sound 2-3 hours. Once most of the water is gone simply wrap the rest of the cloth around the clay and hang it from a place off the ground so it can dry further. When the clay is no longer slimy it’s ready to use

Step 2: the fire

1. Sculpt the tea pets and let them fully dry for a day or more. The color should lighten. 
Put the tea pets in the oven and slowly raise the temperature. While they’re baking you can go outside and set up the fire. If you have a fire pit you can just use that, but since I don’t I just put an old metal pot on top of two bricks and started the fire inside that. 

2. If you have charcoal briquettes then go ahead and use those. If not, try to gather firewood or dry sticks. 

3. Once the fire gets going you can take the tea pets out of the oven and put them directly into the fire. The gradual heating up ensures they are fully dry before they are fired 

4. Keep adding fuel to the fire for as long as you desire. 

5. After 2 hours or so you can let the fire burn out. Wait at least 8 hours (or overnight) so the tea pets are fully cooled down and you don’t accidentally burn yourself 

6. Brush off the ashes and volia! Your teapets are done!

314,tea,"I've gotten into tea recently and maaaan do I love grandpa style. The taste is different each time and I can let each cup steep to the strength I like (VERY strong). Plus it's good for my laziness.

I've been enjoying an oolong I got from Amazon but today I used pu erh. It was delicious, and the caffeine level absolutely bowled me over -- it was way, WAY too much.

Any recommendations for strong, bold teas other than oolongs that have some of the richness of the pu erh but much less caffeine? I know obviously pu erh is pretty distinctive, but at the least I'm looking for something that isn't going to be making weak cups on my third refill.

As for their preferences, they are not a fan of black teas or English teas, nor do they like flavoured teas. They do enjoy green teas and based off of their whisky habits they definitely would enjoy a ripe puerh as well.

Mint tea is my favorite kind. Along with linden \[which i don't have right now\]. Dried cherry stems don't add/change the flavor of the drink it's usually used as a tea for health purposes - diuretic. 

I also added a slice of lemon in the pot and i enjoyed one of the yummiest teas, but I'm biased.

I don't like bitter stuff. Never had. I can't even drink coffee. I can drink cool water, flavored water, milk, juice, soda, hot chocolate, etc with no problem. But I just can't get into tea.

I want to, though. Everyone who likes tea seems to be so passionate about it. All the stuff about health benefits and that air of sophistication just makes me so envious of people who can develop that taste for tea.

But I guess I can't handle anything too bitter or subtle. I need a satisfying amount of sweetness and/or fruitiness to really like a drink.

Maybe I just suck at making tea, though. I've only ever had it when I've tried to make it myself. Like I said, it always just tastes like hot water. Sure, the water turns brown and I can smell the stuff okay, but when I take a sip it's just...echhh...

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Maybe I need to find a flavor that's more suiting to my needs? Maybe I need to actually add sweeteners even though that feels like it's ""cheating?"" Maybe I need to use loose leaf tea?

555,tea,"I've been using electric kettles for 15 years and I feel like I have never had one that combines all the features that one ought to have. Setting aside the cheap ones that just boil off a switch -- I would love a kettle that:

-- showed a ""live"" readout of what the temperature is this moment
-- had easily selectable presets for the various tea temperatures
-- has a decently large top opening for filling and cleaning
-- doesn't leak, which should go without saying but isn't a given

I have had a few that do two (or maybe even three!) of these, but not all four. The Aroma kettle I have at work has a live temp readout (and a cute rainbow LED as the water gets hotter) but the preset temps are annoying to get to (as you have to click through the ""hold at this temp"" setting). I've gone through two Cuisinart kettles at home: the first had easy-to-use presets but no temp readout, and started leaking after two years. The replacement Cuisinart I bought had a temp readout but went to the annoying ""click through multiple buttons to get to the presets"" feature, and also doesn't *actually* come to the temp I selected most of the time (stopping heating at 185 when it's supposed to get to 200, and even sitting and waiting it *might* get to 195).

572,tea,"I tried and reviewed Indian sheng, not exactly ""pu'er"" since that only relates to tea from Yunnan, but a tea made in the same style.  Since Indian Assamica plants aren't identical to Yunnan Assamica it was quite different, but interesting for also being partly the same.  Bitterness was present but warmer dried fruit flavors stood out.  It probably was a good bit more oxidized than typical sheng, accounting for some of the dark leaf appearance, warmer flavor tones, and dark liquid color, but if it really was in between black tea level and normal sheng I wouldn't have expected it to be so bitter.

666,tea,"Hello!

I have an incredible fondness for milky oolong I used to drink in a different country with a chinese friend, but ever since I came back to Slovakia, I have found local ordered oolongs upset my stomach to an incredible degree a few minutes after consumption, up to ""I need to bring a bucket in case"" levels. It literally floors me sometimes. 

There was some time where I drank no oolongs, so this might be a change with age, as I have also found myself more intolerant towards milk. I know for a fact this is not a caffeine reaction, as I drink plenty of coffee and mate and have no side effects. 

I have also ordered what was advertised as expensive authentic milky oolong and other oolongs specifically from a well recommended local site due to recommendations to get as authentic tea as possible, but no dice.

I have an incredible fondness for milky oolong I used to drink in a different country with a chinese friend, but ever since I came back to Slovakia, I have found local ordered oolongs upset my stomach to an incredible degree a few minutes after consumption, up to ""I need to bring a bucket in case"" levels. It literally floors me sometimes. 

There was some time where I drank no oolongs, so this might be a change with age, as I have also found myself more intolerant towards milk. I know for a fact this is not a caffeine reaction, as I drink plenty of coffee and mate and have no side effects. 

I have also ordered what was advertised as expensive authentic milky oolong and other oolongs specifically from a well recommended local site due to recommendations to get as authentic tea as possible, but no dice.

I normally drink my tea unadulterated, but lately I've been in the mood for bubble tea (""boba tea"" for you US west coast folks).

1. Using cheap tea bags, I let the bags steep in hot water and place it in the fridge to start cooling the tea down so that I dont need to use ice for the boba tea. The tea comes out pretty strong, light aroma, and a little bit bitter but the bitter flavor is dulled down when I add in almond mik and homemade brown sugar syrup.
2. I heat up around 10oz of water to 175 F (verified by thermometer), and using a red clay teapot, I let about 5 grams of high quality jasmine pearls steep for 3 minutes. I fill up half a glass with tea and I fill in the rest with 2% milk. The jasmine flavor is almost nonexistent since the milk is a lot stronger

I have been shopping at Spice &amp; Tea Exchange for quite some time now, honestly ever since I began truly enjoying tea 5-6 years ago. I was first introduced the this store in Disney World, and as a big time Disney fan, I find myself down there quite often and typically make my bulk purchases while there and travel home with them. 

This time, I ran out a bit sooner than expected, and did not want to wait until my next trip to restock. I saw that they had free shipping over $45 on their site, so decided to place an order there. I ordered three different teas - 4oz of Iron Goddess of Mercy, 1oz Milk Oolong, and 1oz Organic Yerba Mate. Upon arrival, I was happy to see they were all packaged separately, and packaged very nice at that. But when pulling each out, I immediately noticed a potent smell of spices on each bag. I opened up the bags to smell, and found that the tea itself held that smell as well. I transferred each bag to a sealed glass jar as I typically do in hopes that removing them from the bag would help. Unfortunately, the smell of spice still lingers, albeit a bit lesser than when in the bag. I figured I would try to brew a cup in hopes that it didn't carry over to the palate, but that was not the case. All of the tea has a very prominent spice flavor now, and it is making the tea very difficult to enjoy.

768,tea,"I've recently started drinking Good Earth's Sweet &amp; Spicy caffeine-free tea and found it to be incredibly sweet to the point of being suspicious. While some of their other blends contain stevia, this one does not list it. It does, however, list ""natural flavors"". Given how loose this definition can be in practice, I'd really like to know exactly what I'm drinking.

I'm not the first person to be skeptical, and someone wrote [a blog post about this particular tea in the Huffington Post](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/natural-herbal-tea_b_836251) questioning what natural flavors they use a few years ago. A lot of reviews on Amazon speculate that it is stevia, but I'm pretty sure it's not since I know the taste of stevia and it is listed when included in their other blends. I'd prefer to avoid any sweeteners as well as any other unnecessary additives, natural or otherwise. 

I've emailed them and they won't disclose the precise ingredients but claim that the only flavors used are extracted from cinnamon and orange oil:

&gt;Natural flavors are generally a mixture of flavoring ingredients that are blended together to give the desired flavor profile. The precise composition of a natural flavor(s) are proprietary to the flavor house.

&gt;The flavoring constituents are derived from a spice, fruit, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or other natural source. The flavoring constituents are extracted and purified from the natural source and blended together to produce the natural flavor for a given product. So a natural flavor with a lemon citrus profile may contain natural constituents derived from lemon, but also from e.g. orange, lime, lemongrass etc. 

&gt;In our Sweet &amp; Spicy tea, the “natural flavor” consists of 100% natural extracts from cinnamon cassia, from Indonesia/Vietnam/China, and oil extracted from oranges in USA. The specific combination of these two ingredients, along with the mix of botanicals, account for the sweetness you taste in the tea.

I'm still not entirely convinced. If you've tried it, you know what I'm talking about. Nothing else I've tried with orange or cinnamon flavors has a level of sweetness anywhere close to this tea. I like it, but I would feel a lot better if I knew what was in it.","What do you think of ""natural flavors"" in tea?","I've recently started drinking Good Earth's Sweet &amp; Spicy caffeine-free tea and found it to be incredibly sweet to the point of being suspicious.

&gt;Natural flavors are generally a mixture of flavoring ingredients that are blended together to give the desired flavor profile. The precise composition of a natural flavor(s) are proprietary to the flavor house.

&gt;The flavoring constituents are derived from a spice, fruit, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or other natural source. The flavoring constituents are extracted and purified from the natural source and blended together to produce the natural flavor for a given product. So a natural flavor with a lemon citrus profile may contain natural constituents derived from lemon, but also from e.g. orange, lime, lemongrass etc. 

&gt;In our Sweet &amp; Spicy tea, the “natural flavor” consists of 100% natural extracts from cinnamon cassia, from Indonesia/Vietnam/China, and oil extracted from oranges in USA. The specific combination of these two ingredients, along with the mix of botanicals, account for the sweetness you taste in the tea.

I'm still not entirely convinced. If you've tried it, you know what I'm talking about. Nothing else I've tried with orange or cinnamon flavors has a level of sweetness anywhere close to this tea. I like it, but I would feel a lot better if I knew what was in it.What do you think of ""natural flavors"" in tea?"

Typically for tea and coffee I drink it without anything added or at least I'm trying to. For coffee I still add stuff to make it not so bitter and green tea I typically add just honey. (Have not found a green tea that I like to drink plain... yet)

My girlfriend's birthday is coming up and she's a huge fan of tea sets. Unfortunately, the handle of the pot from the one small set she owns broke a few months ago, and she hasn't had the chance or money to buy a new set. 

I figure this is a great chance to get her something she will use regularly and find a lot of joy in, but I know very little about tea and even less about the tools of the trade. So I ask ye, reddit - what kind of tea set would you want to receive for your birthday? Are there any good sites to look at or even specific sets you've had your eye on? What should I look for when purchasing a set? 

My budget is probably in the ~50-100 range, so no vintage/heritage/hyper fancy stuff. Generally, my girlfriend loves floral patterns and cutesy things, but she's also not super picky and would probably be happy with a variety of styles.

987,tea,"After playing with the first 6 of the 10 YS black teas I've bought based on the love here, I'm pretty disappointed. For half of the teas so far I couldn't manage to get any decent or even halfway interesting brew at all, they're just bland, boring and/or pretty tasteless. Overall I need much more tea than what I'm used to from other vendors to achieve a similar strength, no matter whether western style or gongfu.
Also, the (optical) leaf quality is nowhere near than what is suggested on the pictures. Leaves are all pretty broken, most teas contained signicifant amounts of tiny pieces. Three teas also contain significant amounts of sticks, one of them even seemed like it was intentionally filled with extra sticks, because the top of that bag contained way more sticks than leaves (that one was my favourite though, funnily enough).

Regarding brewing methods I tried western at 90° and 100° and both 2g and 3.5g per 300 mml for 3.5 minutes, and Gongfu with Scotts Parameters, at both 90° as suggested by him and boiling.
For western, boiling and 3.5g produce the best results for all teas, while the other parameters do not work at all. None of them manage to produce a second brew worth drinking.
All of them performed much better using Gongfu. Not with the 90° suggested by YS though, that did not work at all, boiling is consistently way better. Had to be very careful with brewing, they tend to get very bitter very fast.

Overall, while the teas are not bad, I feel like the value for the money is just not there at all, in stark contrast to what is suggested on this sub (in comparison to similar priced tea from european vendors, if you factor in import costs and shipping). Should you decide to buy there, don't get tempted to buy more just to make the import costs worth it like I did.

993,tea,"I know people love to be positive, so I just want to say this is a minor complaint about tea, so I understand people not wanting to have their moods ruined. This is a disclaimer! Stay positive!

 

 

I started my tea journey maybe a year and a half ago. It started with me drinking some tea a relative brought as a gift from a place called Fort and Mason. I tried something called Queen's Blend and loved it! It was black tea, but different than the stuff we got in shops. Eventually the Queen's Blend tea bags were finished and I tried Smoky something. I think what I liked about that was that it was an usual taste, I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me, I think it was the first time I drank tea that felt ""sophisticated"". 

I looked up some tea sites (instead of picking up the usual stuff at the market), and noticed some weird names. Oolog? Puer? What's this? I *had* to know! My search led me to some Don Mei videos, firstly it was one where he described how different teas were made and what the differences were. I was confused and surprised how much information in this world of tea. I looked through his other videos where he tastes different teas and he gives his notes (I love his content!), and I decided I was ready to try some of these ""Chinese teas"". 

To be honest, I was completely ready to just find the whole thing exaggerated and a scam, but I was willing to take the chance and just quit if it wasn't to my liking. I tried to keep an open mind, and so I made my first order from YS, and picked a black tea, a green tea, an oolong, a white and a puer.

 

Wow. This thing was real! I remember the excitement I had, I really loved opening up a bag of tea and not knowing what to expect. I realized some stuff I liked and some stuff I didn't, but I thought it was such an interesting journey (my family wasn't as excited about the ""bad"" teas haha).

 

I've had a few orders since then, and I got pretty busy with work for a time when I noticed I wasn't drinking as much, and so this is what I wanted to share with this great community and see what I think. (here comes negative nancy)

 

1) Preparation; gong fu brewing was nice. Admittedly I *still* don't get everything right every brew, but I get by. I recently started just putting 6~7 grams of tea and fill the gaiwan (which might be 110 or 120ml? if not a bit more) just to make sure I don't get anything watery. However, I noticed sometimes I don't prepare any tea because it can be a real hassle and I'm just not in the mood for it. I know it's part of thee process or ritual, and it gets you the best bang for your buck, but when I'm tired I just want a pitcher ready to pour into my small tea cup with some almonds. I don't want to keep repeating it, but the hassle of the brewing process sometimes stops me. It's made worse by how every brew practically gives me two gulps of tea, so I'm left wanting more but I have to brew it. It's somewhat alleviated by my adjustments recently, and I guess I don't care if I'm spending too many tea leaves since I get what I want, but the issue is still there. One of the hassles I found is that I put *too* much tea, I end up throwing the leaves before spending them.


2) The second problem is the kind of teas. Drinking tea has definitely been an experience, but I noticed that *most* of the teas I had weren't that much to my liking. It feels like there are certain common notes in Chinese teas that I'm not big on. That's not really an issue, but it feels right now that I'm not as excited to explore teas. I love MLX, one of the Jinggus (I forgot which), Lapsang Souchong grew on me. I tried 2 puers and both were awful. I had pine needle the first time and it was great, but later orders were never as good. I loved TGY but lately they get astringent too quickly. It's probably my brewing. But all of these together has left me reluctant to explore teas like I used to, so that love of trying something new isn't there as much.

I'm not really hardcore about this (yet?) and would rather not get too invested until I know what I like. I already have a sampler of Chinese greens on the way, so I think I am set there.

As far as I can tell, there aren't very many Japanese green tea samplers out there, so I made a $20 cart on Yunomi out a few 20g listings of Sencha, Gyokuro, Kukicha, Genmaicha, and Hojicha. I have literally never had any one of these before and have no idea if that's a good way of going about things.

I guess I also got concerned that nearly all the steeping guides are absent my casual basket infuser, particularly Gyokuro which I've read needs room for the leaves to breathe.

Is this the best way of testing the waters of Japanese greens as a complete beginner? Thanks in advance.","I just want to sample a few different varieties of Japanese green tea - can I do it with a basket infuser, and am I going about this right?","Perhaps to headline things, I should note that I've really only had a few loose leaf teas period, and use one of those basket infusers in a mug.

1017,tea,"Now that I have a nice, small but functional collection of different clay teapots for various ages and types of sheng, yancha, Dancong,  and red tea, I am finding that I brew a bit differently in a designated clay teapot versus a gaiwan.

Specifically, I am actually more careful when using a neutral gaiwan as this is what I do when first getting to know a tea. I tend to do a greater number of shorter steeps less than 10 seconds, and use more caution leaving the lid off between steeps. 

But once I feel I understand the nuances of a tea and switch over to using a clay pot, I tend to steep a bit longer (at least 10-15 seconds on first steep, most often 20+ seconds per steep after that) and leave the lid on between steeps. This can vary from tea to tea and pot to pot but I find that it's generally true when switching from using a gaiwan to a pot.

This was not necessarily a conscious strategy but upon thinking more about it, I find that the more casual style is generally more fun with a tea I know well, and I also enjoy very strong flavors in tea, so it makes sense why this method evolved for me. The clay usually helps balance any flaws or issues with doing longer steeps or exposing the tea to more heat. 

Also, most often if I'm sharing tea with someone new I'll use the gaiwan so we can discuss nuances and they smell aromas and see the leaves and tea liquid better as the process unfolds.

1095,tea,"Though this information is fairly irrelevant, I’d love to share why I love tea and the history thats turned me into a complete tea nerd. I read something on this Reddit a few hours ago, saying that tea is more than a drink it’s a memory and I’d like to expand on that idea. For me, tea is not just a single memory so much as it is my history. When I was about 4, I would stay up and have a cup of tea every night with my housekeeper Sandra. A simple cup of Lipton tea with sweetened condensed milk. I looked forward to those few minutes at night where I had a chance to watch her secret ritual of making tea and relaxing; I was so excited and so happy to invited into her nightly routine. For a few years I partook in this nightly tea time and started to feel as though a day hadn’t ended till I had my cup of tea. After few years passed, my teacher and mentor, Bozena, would make a cup of PG tips with a little splash of milk and a spoonful of sugar every morning. For Bozena, this drink was mundane, but to me it was a new potion I was dying to try. After my first sip I fell in love, my morning hadn’t begun till the first drops of builders tea touched my lips. I continued this morning and nightly ritual for about 10 years blissfully unaware of the unexplored world of tea waiting for me. I was 20 when I took a class in New York City; I got off the train In grand central looked up a place to get a cuppa. I found a Japanese tea house called ippodo. In that house, my eyes were opened. I learned of all the different Japanese green tea, first flushes, roasted teas and barley teas. I began collecting every type of tea I could find. I went to restaurants explicitly for their tea menus. At one of the these restaurants I found out about the diverse world of Darjeelings. I became obsessed. I needed new pots, Kyusu’s, pitchers, scales, whisks, filters. Just finding a beautiful tea wasn’t enough it had to be prepared perfectly to express itself correctly. I experimented with every tea I could find till I thought I couldn’t produce a finer liquor. I explored green, black white, yellow, and pu erh teas from all over the world. I finally bought a tea masterclass from rare tea company and learned about oolong... My final frontier. I’ve spent the past year finding every oolong I get my hands on, taking every class I can on Gong fu, got a gaiwan and have had a cup of oolong everyday since, and expect to continue till I can’t physically make tea anymore. I have a few cups a day and can’t think of a time I’m happier unless I with loved ones. Tea has not only marked the different epochs of my life but in someway has become my life. My fondest memories can be brought to the surface with just a whiff of my morning brew. I am so grateful for this wonderful drink and I am so grateful for the people who introduced me to the culture, expanded my knowledge of tea or simply just took the time to share a cup with me. Looking forward to many more cups and looking forward to hopefully introducing others to the wonderful world of tea.

After few years passed, my teacher and mentor, Bozena, would make a cup of PG tips with a little splash of milk and a spoonful of sugar every morning. For Bozena, this drink was mundane, but to me it was a new potion I was dying to try. After my first sip I fell in love, my morning hadn’t begun till the first drops of builders tea touched my lips. I continued this morning and nightly ritual for about 10 years blissfully unaware of the unexplored world of tea waiting for me. I was 20 when I took a class in New York City; I got off the train In grand central looked up a place to get a cuppa. I found a Japanese tea house called ippodo. In that house, my eyes were opened. I learned of all the different Japanese green tea, first flushes, roasted teas and barley teas. I began collecting every type of tea I could find. I went to restaurants explicitly for their tea menus. At one of the these restaurants I found out about the diverse world of Darjeelings. I became obsessed. I needed new pots, Kyusu’s, pitchers, scales, whisks, filters. Just finding a beautiful tea wasn’t enough it had to be prepared perfectly to express itself correctly. I experimented with every tea I could find till I thought I couldn’t produce a finer liquor. I explored green, black white, yellow, and pu erh teas from all over the world. I finally bought a tea masterclass from rare tea company and learned about oolong... My final frontier. I’ve spent the past year finding every oolong I get my hands on, taking every class I can on Gong fu, got a gaiwan and have had a cup of oolong everyday since, and expect to continue till I can’t physically make tea anymore. I have a few cups a day and can’t think of a time I’m happier unless I with loved ones. Tea has not only marked the different epochs of my life but in someway has become my life. My fondest memories can be brought to the surface with just a whiff of my morning brew. I am so grateful for this wonderful drink and I am so grateful for the people who introduced me to the culture, expanded my knowledge of tea or simply just took the time to share a cup with me. Looking forward to many more cups and looking forward to hopefully introducing others to the wonderful world of tea. Sorry for the ramble, Enjoy ur day everyone and enjoyed ur next cup !!Why I love tea"

1290,tea,"I have been trying to get into loose leaf recently. I purchased a container of Jasmine Green Tea (sunflower brand), but it tastes completely different from what I normally drink. It's not bad, but I think usually there's a stronger floral smell when I brew tea bag brands.

1296,tea,"The title is pretty self-explanatory. My partner is a big fan of tea and for years now I have tried to make the switch. First it was black teas then it was White T's then it was various green teas but all with the same result. Every time I have a cup of tea has caffeine in it I end up with a really bad headache and I assume it's because of the tannins in the tea because I don't get the same effect from coffee. Today I stopped off at my local tea shop to try out a cup of matcha and the result has been a really bad headache that has put me in a dark room with noise canceling headphones on to try and cope.

Does the community here have any tips or tricks for overcoming this?",Caffinated teas give me horrible headaches.,"The title is pretty self-explanatory.

I bought the tea mentioned above, knowing that matcha is meant to be powdered to actually prepare it the normal way, but when I opened it to try and make some, the leaves were pretty identical to any other loose leaf green tea. I tried grinding it down smaller with a mortar and pestle, but that was really not good, and then I tried just brewing it like other teas, but that wasn't really good either.

1316,tea,"Hey there just started my tea journey earlier this year and was wondering how high quality teas are categorized beyond if they're black, green, oolong etc. It's honestly pretty confusing. Is it based off region, cultivar or what? Seems like most tea places online don't list any additional information, they just tell you how it's processed and give it a fluffy name to entice you.

1327,tea,"I really enjoyed the videos Meileaf puts out on tea expeditions to various places in China combined with explanations of the tea, how it is made etc.

I was surprised/bummed to see a fair amount of negative cmmts abt their teas here, but decided to take the plunge and make a couple small purchases- specifically a Tieguanyin (‘Baked goods’) and a Lapsang Souchong (‘Souchong liquor’). 

I just tried the Tieguanyin and was very happy, particularly with the long lasting creamy finish. YMMV but I think these certainly pass muster as great teas. 

Price wise they were at a discount, but even at full price only 0.30 and 0.33 USD per gram- so at the very lower end of usual range of 0.30 to 0.50 per g for great teas.

Has anyone else bought from Meileaf and enjoyed it ? Or not? Happy to hear any thoughts.","Meileaf teas - so far, so great","I really enjoyed the videos Meileaf puts out on tea expeditions to various places in China combined with explanations of the tea, how it is made etc.

1358,tea,"Hi! I am new to tea drinking and started drinking Green Tea two-three years back for health reasons. I started with tea bags from brands like Lipton/Typhoo/Twinning etc and still mostly drink from them. The most *fancy* brand that I have tried was Harney &amp; Sons. I mostly drink Green Tea but I like Black Tea specifically Earl Grey and recently tried Oolong. My most favourite Green Tea flavour is Jasmine scented Green tea but recently I got Mint flavoured one and decided to try it even though i dont really like the flavour. I found that while i like to drink Jasmine scented one hot, I liked the mint one at slightly lower temperature. I dont really know if this is an actual thing or something that is specifically personally to me. I had a chance to visit a tea garden in 2019 and came to know that different teas have different brewing temperatures for example Green teas have slightly lower brewing temperatures than Oolongs. But I dont know about different flavours.

1376,tea,"My favorite teas over all others are Fujian black teas like zhengshan xiaozhong, jin jun mei with more dark leaves and less buds, golden monkey, bai lin, specially ones with not too heavy on the cocoa notes, and stronger on the longan, roasted sugar cane, dry hay flavor.

Some of the best tasting ones I've had are some zhengshan xiaozhong ones that i have gotten as gifts from a cousin who doesn't drink tea, but kept getting them as gifts from some chinese friends who I have never met.

These come in tiny plastic bags that are good for about one brew each, that come in bigger boxes, but it's not very much tea in total. This was all like at least 5 years ago, she doesn't get the teas anymore and I don't have much contact with her, and I never met the chinese people who gave them to her. I've been trying to find similar tasting ones online. The ones i got don't have any identifiable sources on them, just generic terms in chinese like ""famous red tea"", ""zhengshanxiaozhong"", ""sweet aroma"", ""genuine source"".

I have sometimes been lucky in buying teas that taste like this (the best ones i've found have often been the cheaper ones, like the cheapest golden monkey from Yunnan Sourcing about 3 years ago), but i always feel it's a gamble and when i have bought from online tea stores sometimes they have been very chocolate heavy, sometimes slightly smoky, sometimes the opposite, something that tastes ""wet"". Actually several of the more expensive zzxz teas have been this way, and had description of being ""floral"", I don't really know what flowers smell like that, more like old apples and rotting oak leaves in my opinion.

Does anyone know some online tea vendor that is specialized on Fujian blacks, (like what-cha is special for great teas from unusual tea regions, yunnan sourcing on yunnanese teas and so on). Preferably one that ships from an EU country. 

And if not, do you know some good zsxz or golden monkey or similar that has a very ""dry"" and also non-chocolaty, but longan-juice like aroma that is for sale anywhere else?",Finding some good Fujianese black tea?,"My favorite teas over all others are Fujian black teas like zhengshan xiaozhong, jin jun mei with more dark leaves and less buds, golden monkey, bai lin, specially ones with not too heavy on the cocoa notes, and stronger on the longan, roasted sugar cane, dry hay flavor.

I have sometimes been lucky in buying teas that taste like this (the best ones i've found have often been the cheaper ones, like the cheapest golden monkey from Yunnan Sourcing about 3 years ago), but i always feel it's a gamble and when i have bought from online tea stores sometimes they have been very chocolate heavy, sometimes slightly smoky, sometimes the opposite, something that tastes ""wet"". Actually several of the more expensive zzxz teas have been this way, and had description of being ""floral"", I don't really know what flowers smell like that, more like old apples and rotting oak leaves in my opinion.

Does anyone know some online tea vendor that is specialized on Fujian blacks, (like what-cha is special for great teas from unusual tea regions, yunnan sourcing on yunnanese teas and so on). Preferably one that ships from an EU country. 

And if not, do you know some good zsxz or golden monkey or similar that has a very ""dry"" and also non-chocolaty, but longan-juice like aroma that is for sale anywhere else?Finding some good Fujianese black tea?"

I haven’t found any teas I like. 

I’ve had green teas, black teas, teas with fruit, hibiscus teas, and breakfast teas. I haven’t really enjoyed any of them that much. 

Can you all recommend some teas on the sweeter side, or perhaps ones with a strong, fruity flavor? I’m willing to try all suggestions, as long as they aren’t super expensive.

1396,tea,"It's been about 3 months now since I stared drinking ""proper"" tea. (Not tisane's/ infusions). I've tried English breakfast, green, Dilmah, local Australian, earl grey, Yorkshire, pre infused, unaltered, tea bags, loose leaf, in a pot, in a cup, with milk, straight, with lemon juice and with honey. 

My thoughts are as follows:

It does take an initial period of stubbornly drinking poorly made tea for an adult who is unfamiliar with it to first become accustomed to both the bitterness and subtleties of tea as a whole. Starting out all I could taste was bitter. Now I can taste so much more. 

Tea seems to invite and reward experimentation. In order to make a cup of tea that you thoroughly enjoy you have to change the way you prepare it one piece at a time. It can't be rushed it must be prepared and savoured, taking note of what you did and what you change each time. When you find one of the many sweet spots there is to find its both delicious and fulfilling. 

Once you've found a sweet spot comes the best part of being into tea! Sharing! Nothing in my 27 years has given me quite the same feeling as sharing a cup of tea with my brother and him telling me it's good. While it's nice to drink alone there is just something special about tea that makes it feel more of a social drink. 

I look forward to further experiments and discoveries. Right now I'm drinking a lot of Yorkshire tea with about 1:6 milk to water I think. I do like to add a small 1/2 teaspoon of honey but it's still nice without. Unfortunately I got a bit over enthusiastic and bought like 100 tea bags of it so I might be drinking it for a while yet. My only complaint is the flavour can be really hard to bring out just right. I've been steeping for just over 5 minutes and trying to get just the right amount of milk and honey but it's so easy to completely drown out the flavour. If I every buy Yorkshire again I'll probably try the ""proper strong"" variety.

One thing of particular note is the Australian grown loose leaf tea I have. This particular leaf is probably the most bitter I've had. But there's a subtle distinction in this one. They say the tea plant is very sensitive to the environment it's grown and I could swear there is the faintest hint of eucalyptus in this tea. As someone who loves the smell of eucalyptus, I'm definitely looking forward to more experimenting with this tea and trying to bring that flavour out more.",3 months in.

This explains the more mild “awake” feeling you get from tea, as opposed to the jitters you get from coffee.  Does anyone else have some information they can add to this?  I’ve poked around a bit, but if you want to get the real info, I figured this is the right spot

1509,tea,"There have been a number of posts lately asking about caffeine in tea. A casual internet search gives conflicting information, so I found some sources with actual lab results.

I'll try to avoid getting overly wordy, but most of the ""facts"" that I'm about to list are my interpretation of the data from the sources and are averages. I've linked my sources at the end in case anyone wants more nuanced information.

**tl;dr: A cup of average American grocery store tea will have about 40mg of caffeine.**

&amp;#x200B;

* Most dry tea leaves are between 2% and 4% caffeine (20-40mg of caffeine per gram of dry tea).
* A one-minute steep extracts about a quarter of that and a five-minute steep extracts one-half to three-quarters of it.
* Hotter water extracts more caffeine, so a larger volume of tea brewed in a warmed, covered pot has more caffeine than one serving brewed in a cup or mug. Even warming your mug first will have a big effect.
* ""Wild-type"" *assamica* tea trees have more caffeine than Chinese-type trees. Assam and pu erh teas have more caffeine than Darjeeling, Sri Lankan, Kenyan, and ""regular"" Chinese teas.
* Most production processes (green, white, oolong, black) don't affect caffeine content of the finished tea.
* Producing ripe, ""wet pile"" pu erh actually increases caffeine content. Good pu erh starts at around 4%, but ripening can push that to more than 5% (I'm guessing that the ""wet pile"" allows some enzyme action to continue). An 8 gram gong fu session of ripe pu erh may release 400mg of caffeine.
* The younger the leaves, the more caffeine, with buds having the highest content. Silver needle white and ""golden"" teas have more caffeine than average. Shou mei white and large-leaf oolongs have less than average.
* Caffeine slowly breaks down over time, so aged tea will have somewhat less caffeine than recently produced tea.
* More broken tea infuses quicker than big pieces. At one minute, a lot less caffeine is extracted from whole leaf tea, but it's mostly caught up by five.

So, one takeaway from this is that green tea having less caffeine is *sort of* true. Green tea is typically brewed with cooler water and for less time than black tea, both of which reduce caffeine extraction. If you either brew it the same as black tea or gong fu it until you can't taste it anymore, then you'll get the full dose.

Can anyone specify what filters like Brita are specifically filtering out to be better suited for tea? I notice that the total dissolved solid content for water going through my brita is similar to that of tap water, so I don’t really understand.

I brew according to directions in a ceramic tea pot and drink it in a ceramic mug.

I often do have the cup sitting around for like 10 mins+ before I start drinking and only drink small sips so that it can cool down enough.

I'm sick of feeling anxious, dehydrated, nauseous and shaky all the time. After almost two decades of excessive coffee drinking, I've had enough.

Today marks the fifth day without coffee and I feel incredible. Anxiety is down by probably 60%, I feel lighter, better and more clear-headed. I'm currently substituting with sugar-free energy drinks (180 mg caffeine) and one cup of black tea a day, to ward of withdrawals.

It's working like a charm, but my long-term goal is moving away from energy drinks and onto the world of tea.

I love the flavor of coffee, and seem to have found a similar love for black tea.

Currently, I drink Lipton Russian Earl Grey, which seems to have a 'smokier' and more citrus-y taste -- which I like.

Do you have any tea recommendations for a ex-coffee drinker to try?

**My idea is this:**

1. A full-bodied, darker tea with a bit more caffeine to start my mornings (pu-erh?)
2. A fresh, healthy green tea to continue my afternoons (matcha?)

In reviewing teas, and to some extent judging them, it seems potentially negative to say that they're good but implying that they could be higher in quality, more type-typical, or a better match for my preferences.  I don't intend it as overly negative saying that a tea is good but one atypical aspect or limitation stands out. Reviews shouldn't be marketing content, where every tea is just fantastic.  This producer makes a lot of interesting blends, catering to US consumer preference, and I expect those to be really novel and positive.  Both these teas were good though, and interesting for being novel.  For them not being very many years into production they're a lot better than I expected.

1630,tea,"I was excited to try Yunnan Sourcing after seeing so many people here rave about it, but I feel I must be missing something important with their teas as each one seems to be less flavorful than the last. This was my first order and I've been trying them in the order shown. All were brewed western style using fresh, filtered water.

King of Duck Shit was okay. Oolong teas are my favorite and this was my first time trying a dan cong. I thought the flavor was a bit too light, but I didn't hate it. Steeped at 195°F for 3 minutes.  
Onto the next, Sweet Ya Bao was refreshing but, once again, I felt the flavor was very light, even for a white tea. Steeped at 185°F for 3 minutes.

I just poured myself a cup of Mao Feng and I'm really having a hard time convincing myself I'm not just drinking water. This tastes like I poured water into a cup that had a little bit of tea residue in it from earlier. Steeped at 175°F for 3 minutes.

I think the obvious answer is to just steep all the teas for longer durations, but I've become incredibly skeptical. I'm drinking these teas right from their pouches after no exposure to light and air, I'm using filtered water and I'm using more leaves and less water for steeping than I use with other tea sellers.

I really want to like these teas - the order came out to $100 after shipping, so I'm burned that I spent so much to try a new tea seller, but I wanted a large enough selection to find something I'd want to order again.

I even tried 4gr on a dose (so about 128mg caffeine) and still I didn't get the same boost as a cup of coffee with the half amount of caffeine.

Should I try a different label of matcha or matcha just isn't for me? Any recommendations? I don't care at all about the taste, I just want something that's more healthy than coffee for an energy boost on afternoons mostly. I would prefer to buy from somewhere that's in European Union.

Should I try a different label of matcha or matcha just isn't for me? Any recommendations? I don't care at all about the taste, I just want something that's more healthy than coffee for an energy boost on afternoons mostly. I would prefer to buy from somewhere that's in European Union.

Thank youMatcha for energy"

And, while I appreciate how interesting and complex the tea word gets, I really would like a specific brand that I can jump online and order. I do find tea interesting. It has a lot of history, lots of study, and so many things to know. However, all I am asking here is what tea do you use to get this sensation? Specifically, what brand/product?Tea Drunkenness?"

I wanted to see how others select the tea for these sessions? Typically mine have lasted 2-4 hours and we go through many teas. I usually choose my teas as follows:

1) a light green such as a laoshan to show them that green teas are different than what we see at grocery stores. I also often start with a Taiping Houkui as the leaves are beautiful and this usually captures people’s interest. 

2) A floral Dan Cong oolong to introduce floral notes but also a little more of the oxidized slightly earthy flavours. Everyone has really enjoyed the YS honey orchid oolong as it’s a fantastic tea. 

3) a roasted oolong to shift into the toasty and earthy flavours more directly. I often use the YS 3x charcoal roasted oolong here. 

4) a nice malty black tea as these have a depth and richness you don’t see in bagged teas. Everyone always likes these. YS black gold Bi Lou chun is my go-to here. 

4) for here, if they want more earthiness I offer pu’er, or if they preferred the greens and oolongs we go back to those based around what they particularly enjoyed.

Dilute with 8 oz of cold water, ice, milk, and sweetener. I find that with this method I always have weaker tea than I would get at a restaurant or tea shop.

This difference, seemed to make a massive difference in the taste of the tea.  I guess my previous efforts just had tea steeping in water that was too hot.

This being the case, successful recovery is a matter of livelihood, so I’m doing everything I can do be gentle. 

I’ve turned to Tea again. 

I had to stay clear of any caffeine or herbal drinks for quite some time to prepare for my day under the knife, so suffice to say, I was excited for a cup of something once I was done. 

I’m not a prisoner, I live freely by most definitions one could find in an academic text, I’m happy, and have been lucky on most accounts. But, due to my physical condition, I do find myself in a position where I can’t leave the physical space I’m in.

-One generic “Oolong”, in bags that I’ve been pulling open to brew loose leaf

-One generic “White” same deal as the Oolong 

 ... and I have a small matcha tea set with some Ippodo matcha. 

Oh and some “Ti Kuan Yin“ tea with little rose buds in it. I don’t really know what it is though ...

Over the last two days I’ve gently cycled through them. I’ve found great enjoyment in the Oolong. To me it tastes like a smoky graham cracker. I don’t really know if I’m using the correct ratios of water to leaf, or the exact right temperatures. But in any case, I made something that was enjoyable, albeit somewhat weak, though I think it worked. This has been my favorite tea to make so far. 

Still I want to hone my preparation of the Jasmine tea that I have. I love the aromas of the flower, it’s scent drew me the most to drink tea again in recovery. I’ll spend time today giving this task specific attention. I have this hunch that I’ll somehow unlock floral depth that will project me into Iroh’s tea shop, if I get it right, hopefully I’m not delusional. ;)

But unlike me, they have all the natural tools needed to embody Zen that I only can  imagine attempting to achieve using my leaf water. 

Finding some solace in Tea again has been a gift both rich and illusive. A wonderful relationship of form and substance represented in a simple ritual. It has in these short days encouraged my mental energy in the direction of “How” and less the “What”.

I made it and liked it, a little stronger on the Earl Grey, but I may try to lower the amount of tea.  I also didnt have any cookies, so that may make the strong EG taste better.  I also couldnt get it to whip, but it still turned out fine.

    2 t loose  Earl Grey tea
    2 t pure vanilla extract

Instructions

Combine the heavy cream and tea leaves in a medium-sized saucepan and heat over medium heat, occasionally stirring. Bring to a boil and remove once it starts boiling. Set aside to cool.

Once cooled, strain to remove the tea leaves, then transfer to a large bowl and place into the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

    16.5 oz. heavy whipping cream
    14 oz. sweetened condensed milk
    2 t loose  Earl Grey tea
    2 t pure vanilla extract
    4-6  shortbread cookies, crumbled


Instructions

Combine the heavy cream and tea leaves in a medium-sized saucepan and heat over medium heat, occasionally stirring. Bring to a boil and remove once it starts boiling. Set aside to cool.

Once cooled, strain to remove the tea leaves, then transfer to a large bowl and place into the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Remove from the refrigerator and add the vanilla extract. Whip on high until peaks form.

Fold in the sweetened condensed milk, then cover and freeze for 2 hours.

Remove from the freezer and fold in the crumbled shortbread cookies. Cover again and freeze for 6-8 hours or overnight.

When ready to serve, use a warm ice cream scoop or let the ice cream soften at room temperature for about 10 minutes.Earl Grey Ice Cream"

2133,tea,"I am trying to save cash or at least up the quality of the tea I'm ingesting.  I literally spend upwards of 200 dollars a month on Starbucks iced tea or coffee bean tea.  At 3.65 a pop a couple times a day it adds up.

I like Starbucks blackniced tea and I tracked down the type to royal English breakfast.  I found some online and the first time I made it it tasted great.  But then something was always off.  I don't know if it's the bottled water I'm using or something else.

Is there a. Ideal water type to use to boil?  Not tap, but what? Is filtered water OK?  Does it need to be balanced?  My current filter puts some minerals in to make it more alkaline, is that bad for tea taste?

Is there a tea that is more forgiving?  I am in search of something  I can make that is consistently refreshing that does not come across with some kind of style flavor.  Maybe it is variation in the teas I've been buying.  Do they need to be more fresh?  Larger leaves instead of bags?

The inconsistency is turning me off to the point where I'm just going to settle for buying the tea ready made.  But even there it's not consistent.  Starbucks tea tastes off sometimes too.  Maybe they used a different blend, or maybe they did not dilute it with enough water so it's too bitter.  The perfect tea is God damn amazing, but it seems so easy and common to have it come out sideways.

I am currently taking pottery classes and wanted to make my own tea pet. I'm from the UK, have never had a tea pet before and thought it would be nice to make my first one. Bare in mind that I haven't ever seen a tea pet in real life, only online. 

I'm struggling to find any resources specifically about making tea pets. What l have found out is listed below but I have a question about each point, if anyone can help. 

- the type of clay traditionally used. Will a different clay work for a tea pet? I only have access to a standard white clay in my classes. 

- traditional tea pets are usually fired on a kiln at around 2100F. Would this be different for the clay I'll be using but any ideas of a rough guesstimate? I'm sure my teacher will instinctively know but I'd like to know myself. 

- tea pets are usually unglazed and some are hollow (I think to make water exit via holes left in the tea pet). Or are they all hollow? 

Any wisdom anyone has to offer is appreciated and I'll update with my tea pet creation if all goes to plan.",Tea pet making,"Hello Tea lovers,

2180,tea,"What teas do you like to cold brew and whats your story of getting into it, what do you love most about it? heres mine:

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started trying cold brewing my tea, after noticing that I really havn't been drinking it much because its summer and been really warm (plus just the extra time needed to be put in to make it hot). So over the course of days I've tried various different teas I've had sitting around, ones I like and ones I don't, as cold brew. My normal second flush darjeeling is just as great as ever. The autumnal darjeeling that I didn't really like (but didn't really dislike that much) turned out to be amazing though. It came out so sweet with no astringency or anything like that, but still with the signature darjeeling muscatel taste. Only problem with that is that its kinda expensive to buy that tea and its not going to always be available. 

Teas I didn't like turned out to still be teas I didn't like when cold, minus the autumnal darjeeling (including first flush and white darjeeling, a green tea I still had sitting around, ect). Some teas I like turned out ok, but after a few different teas I didn't find anything as great as the autumnal darjeeling. The closest I had got at that point was an english breakfast I had from a local place. Knowing that I've gotten a better version of another tea by getting it from a different source I decided to try that. I was right, getting a higher quality tea was exactly what I needed, the sweetness and black tea taste I was looking for was there. Obviously its not the same as a autumnal darjeeling, that will just have to be a special treat I get occasionally. 

My partner has loved the dame grey brewed cold. he loves how it really brings out the lemon flavor. I just wish I could find another source for that tea, a higher quality one. But I'm stuck sticking with the local tea source I got it from. 

I got the [Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Tea Pot](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C15F2SC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) (two of them) and I've been amazed by how nice and easy it is to cold brew.

My sister does not like coffee at all however. I'm going to move down to the city she is in for college in a couple weeks and I would love some suggestions on some basic aspects of making good tea. I just want to invite her over a couple times a month or so and be able to sit down with her and enjoy our hot beverages. I want her to be able to enjoy her tea as much as I am able to enjoy my coffee.

My first question: where can I buy quality tea? I asked my sister what kind of tea she likes and she replied with ""I prefer herbal teas and I look for ones that have an interesting combo of ingredients."" She also said ""I generally like fruity, flowery, or earthy teas"" I remember in the past she said she doesn't like anything ""too spiced"" or ""too spicy"". I am unfamiliar with what ingredients cause that spice though. So building on that question, I was wondering what are, in a generic sense, the main ingredients that I would want to look for and what would I want to avoid?

My second question: What is the best way to manually brew around a liter of tea? I really enjoy the process of pourover coffee, and I was wondering if there is anything similar to that process in the world of tea. I have a 1L variable temp electric kettle and an Acaia Pearl scale which doubles as a timer.

\~Jack",I want to brew my sister some excellent tea,"Hello people of r/Tea! I know very little about tea and how to properly brew a good cup. I am very big into coffee; I buy fresh roasted and mainly use a pourover method. My sister does not like coffee at all however. I'm going to move down to the city she is in for college in a couple weeks and I would love some suggestions on some basic aspects of making good tea. I just want to invite her over a couple times a month or so and be able to sit down with her and enjoy our hot beverages. I want her to be able to enjoy her tea as much as I am able to enjoy my coffee.

My first question: where can I buy quality tea? I asked my sister what kind of tea she likes and she replied with ""I prefer herbal teas and I look for ones that have an interesting combo of ingredients.""

Long time french vanilla coffee drinker here...or creamer with a splash of coffee :) I am trying to cut back my sugar intake and want to give morning tea a try. But I can't seem to find a caffeinated vanilla tea (caramel or something along those flavors would also work) with my allergy requirements:

NO Soy, NO cinnamon and also No added sugar. 

I am in the US, so something local preferable. I know I could mix in flavors, but hoping for a bag and run sort of deal if it's out there.

I’ve been searching extensively online and on Amazon, but I’m not quite finding the exact combo I’m looking for.  Anyway- what I am hoping to find is an electric tea kettle that:
Nonnegotiable-
*option to customize brewing temps by the +\- 1 degree.  Presets are fine, but I really want to be able to modify it by the degree
*delay start function
*no plastic parts at all, although I’d consider one that used some safe plastic on parts that do not contact the water at all (like the handle or lcd screen or something)
*keep warm function
*infuser insert
*auto shut-off
*wide range keep warm temps 

Preferences- (but negotiable/not necessary)
*real-temp function so I know what temp the water is at
*brew-time watch/timer
*led light to show when water is boiling or at desired temp
*mute button

I’m actually not too concerned with it being able to boil super fast.  

It would be awesome if they designed something like this either a gooseneck.  (I know, I know, I’m asking too much now!!!)

What is your best ""free ride"" tea specifically for anxiety and/or relaxation?

Let me explain...I haven't actually seen the clip but have heard this quote more than a few times...it appears to be attributed to Joe Rogan on his podcast and it makes sense...it's super obvious but little said...basically it goes like there is no such thing as a ""free ride"" or a ""free lunch"" so to speak when it comes to putting anything into our bodies. Pretty much everything can have a positive effect but that comes along with a negative effect. Some way more imbalanced than others. Water is basically great for you but even that you can overdo. Alcohol has some positive effects (arguable) but comes along with a boat load of negative health implications and so on...you get the idea.

I had a problem with alcohol years ago and have fortunately been sober for a number of years. I really got into tea and that was a game changer for helping me kick the habit. Pretty boring in terms of herbs but I really enjoy my high end loose leaf English Breakfast and Earl Grey in the morning...because I have trouble sleeping I have to stop anything with caffeine early and will usually have some chamomile in the afternoon and a cup of something with valerian before bed.

Recently, I was curious about kava and tried it a few times. The relaxation effect was incredible and I thought, wow, I really found a great natural relaxation thing here but found the side effects of pretty extreme lethargy and dehydration not worth the ride so to speak.

That experience is what got me thinking about this post...what are some herbs/teas that you take, that help you, with anything really, but I'm specifically curious about anxiety/relaxation that are about as close to a ""free ride"" as you can get? In other words, things that are safe to take regularly without much in the way of negative health side effects?

So far I haven't seen anything that indicates chamomile is bad for you to consume in just about any quantity. I have heard mixed things about valerian, so I just stick to one cup before bed, but curious about what others have found.","Best ""Free Ride"" Tea For Anxiety/Relaxation?","

A court ruling just evicted David from his Last Resort CA home, the conclusion of a very long legal battle over building permit and code violations, effective within one month now.   This overview only lays out some main themes, about his personal history with tea as a pioneering vendor in the 1990s, with a little on related storage themes.  Why he did what he did was especially moving, about home development as a pursuit of architectural art, and small-scale experimental wastewater treatment systems.

He was the main subject of the All In This Tea documentary, and owner of the Phoenix Tea Collection, which now relates to about 25,000 kgs of stored pu'er and hei cha.  A court ruling just evicted David from his Last Resort CA home, the conclusion of a very long legal battle over building permit and code violations, effective within one month now.   This overview only lays out some main themes, about his personal history with tea as a pioneering vendor in the 1990s, with a little on related storage themes.  Why he did what he did was especially moving, about home development as a pursuit of architectural art, and small-scale experimental wastewater treatment systems.

2461,tea,"Hey all,  


Recently I changed careers, from late night hospitality to very early morning education, which requires a good hit of caffeine to get me going. My issue is I'm way past my days of energy drinks and I'm actually allergic to Coffee. I've never really liked to but figured that was very probably down to only having terrible Australian supermarket teabags.  


So I figure I'll do my research, find a place locally and head on in. Went to my local Tea Center and picked up small bags of a decent Assam, their Stockholme blend and a spiced chai. I've tried the Assam and Stockholme twice now and.....I'm just not getting it.  


For reference;  
**Assam** \- I have done 2 brews;  
Brew 1 - 200ml to 1 tsp (no digital scale), 92 degree filtered water, 5 minute brew time. This was super weak, water with a bit of flavour. Dads English so after a bit of trying it I threw in some milk and sugar to see if that improved it. Got slightly better but still bland.  
Brew 2 - 200ml to 2 tsp, 92 degree filtered water, 6 minute brew time. This was better but still not what I THOUGHT tea would be, some leaves also fell out of my mesh spoon thing so it got more and more bitter over time.  


**Stockholme** \- Same measurements as above really, no milk or sugar though. Boy oh boy was this disappointing, nothing I've done so far has got sufficient flavour (for me) out of this which is disappointing given the intensity of the smell.  


**Chai** \- Haven't tried it yet, I know I'm meant to heat purely milk in a pot with the spices which sounds very much my style but also means it not really a ""quick brew before work"" thing.  


I realise that when I'm drinking teas not built for or served with milk and sugar it's always going to be....watery (that sounds stupid to say) but I really expected more flavour, more experience out of these types of blends and I'm wondering the following;  


Is there some magical point/process where suddenly the flavour will be there?  
Or am I expecting the wrong thing from tea and it's always going to be more subtle flavours?  


Especially with milk + sugar I expected the results to be rich and creamy, which is really what I want from my morning wake up brew (I love rich, warm comforting flavours...not much for fruit/bitter etc). Being a chef for years I want bold, intense flavour.  


Any tips, advice, discussion etc would be greatly appreciated. I've get plenty more of each tea to keep experimenting and it's not like the flavours are offensive or bad, just not what I expected.","Beginner Questions - Some doesn't seem right, my expectations or my process?","Hey all,

2556,tea,"I bought Milk Oolong Supreme from Tealyra. As I'm from Taiwan, I've had good quality Milk oolong from Taiwan from time to time and know how natural milkiness smells like.

There's a sour aftertaste in my mouth.

No authentic milk oolong could be processed in that way. It is only feeding the rumor about milk oolong.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I don’t drink tea, and I’m not a fan of it. I always preferred coffee over tea. But recently, our team joined a new colleague. She is a new marketing manager, and she came to the US from the UK. Besides, she has recently arrived from the UK, and she doesn’t really know anybody. It seems like she feels so lonely in our country, and I’ve decided to cheer her up with a small welcome gift. Hopefully, it will help her to overcome her homesickness.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve noticed that she rarely drinks coffee and consistently brews tea for herself. So, our corporate kitchen now is full of delightful scents. Besides, every time I enter her office, she has a cup of tea and a scone. So, I’m thinking of getting her a tea set and maybe a pack of high-quality tea. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the issue is that I have no idea what kind of tea she drinks. I’m talking about the brand specifically. I’ve googled some of the most popular tea brands in the UK, and it seems like maybe 90% of the population loves the brand Twinings. I had no idea that this brand has existed since at least the 1820s. They also have a large selection of different teas starting from the very basic ones. Besides, they don’t say black tea. Instead, they call it ‘English Breakfast.’ By this, they mean only the beverage and not food. This fact is fascinating for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily for me, I can find this tea in the US too. So, it’s not exclusive for Brits only. But I wonder what some tea experts think of this brand? Is it worth purchasing a selection of Twinings tea as a gift? Besides, I was thinking of buying a teapot with the cup in addition to tea.

2) **Withering:** The leaves are put on the withering table &amp; leave the tea for 10-20 hours, in this stored process 73-80% of moisture goes down to 60-65%.for an excellent quality tea it is very important to wither done evenly.  


3) **Rolling:** This process putting withering tea into the rolling machine (two large round metal plates that run in different directions).20-60 minutes' rolling process required expertise to decide upon the right amount of pressure.  


4) **Fermenting:** This process lasts 2-5 hours, during this time black tea will develop its characteristic flavor and aroma while losing its astringent and bitter test.  


5) **Drying:** In 20-30 minutes of drying process most important. In flat conveyor belts, tea runs through a giant oven with 95-degree hot air that reduces moisture content and gives long tea and color.  


6) **Sorting:** Mechanical sieves will sort the tea according to tea-leaf grades.

This covers a lot of all that, it's just a bit random on what gets addressed and what doesn't.  This version was nice but a little more oxidized than sheng typically would be, which might be seen as a flaw by many, or could be preferable for some.

2687,tea,"I absolutely adore the savory character of genmaicha, but it's hard for me to find anything similar. So far, I've tried:

- Hojicha based on bancha: I don't know if I got a bad batch, but this smelled strongly of and tasted like a liquefied fish harbor. Not very pleasant.

- Kukicha: Very refreshing and goes well with savory foods, but not very savory on its own.

- Yunnan black/dianhong: This was neat, but reminded me so much of eatery streets (xiaochijie) in China that it got me a bit queasy when I wasn't in the mood for fast food. Not sure if it's an association by memory.

- Da Hong Pao: I really liked this, the sample I got was very mineral and savory in character, too. I just don't know how to fit  gongfu brewing into my everyday tea-drinking routine, I can't exactly fiddle with a gaiwan in front of my laptop.

- Sencha: Not sure if it's just the sample I got, but not a fan. It was more grassy than vegetal/savory.

- Lapsang souchong: I love it! It's more smoky than savory, though.

I've also been told to try corn silk tea and gyokuro, so they're on my to-try list. But the corn silk tea is only available here at an online vendor with pretty steep shipping prices, and the gyokuros at my fave tea shop all have reviews that say they're ""light and grassy"" rather than ""umami and broth-like"" like I've been told they can be, so I would love more suggestions if you have any.",Recommendations for a genmaicha lover?,"I absolutely adore the savory character of genmaicha, but it's hard for me to find anything similar.

After that, I bought a 180ml gaiwan and a 280ml gaiwan but when I received those, the measurements were up to the very top brim, making them too small for my use. My intention was to use the 180ml gaiwan to brew 6oz of water while using the 280ml gaiwan to brew 8-9oz of water. 

So when one is buying a new gaiwan, what on Earth does the advertised milliliter size have to do with the gaiwan?

2710,tea,"I can't ever seem to get past bitterness in food and beverages. I hate beer because it's all bitter, even malty beer with little hops. The only way I can get past the bitterness of coffee is with a lot of cream and sugar, so I just don't drink it. Unfortunately, tea seems to be in the same boat. I can't seem to get the tasting notes because they all tend to taste like bitter warm water. 

I would like to note that I am very careful about steeping temperatures and time. I use loose leaf tea only -single origin, blends, and herbals- in a Kinto glass tea kettle. I use spring water to avoid high mineral content, chlorine, and other gases that may affect the flavor profile. I use an electric kettle that I can set to the exact degree required. I have done a vigorous amount of research on tea from selecting, purchasing, steeping, infusion, gaiwan, tea tasting, flavor profile charts, etc. - and I have thoroughly enjoyed the journey. I feel like I have a solid grasp on tea as a whole.

Am I doomed? Has my American palate made my mission to enjoy unaltered tea an impossible task? A DNA test did confirm that I am ""highly likely to taste bitter"". Yay. I often smell what I am suppose to taste, like the apple note in today's Darjeeling was obvious to my olfactory sense, but I don't ever taste those notes. Is there anything I'm overlooking? Is there anything else I can do? Or do I just accept that the only way I will ever enjoy tea is with the help of sweeteners and other additives?

My sister and I bought a few teas from a local place, in general a lot of it was either kind of bad or mediocre. This rooibois in particular we thought was off however neither of us have actually had it before so it's hard to tell.

When opening the bag the smell is super strong, almost syrupy in a way. Once brewed the smell is still there but a tad weaker. Upon tasting my sister said it tasted like olives, and while personally I'm not sure that's how I would describe it there definitely was a strong aftertaste that just didn't seem right.

Does pouring the water out really cool it that quickly? Or is it because the mugs are room temperature and that caused the extreme temperature shift?

2802,tea,"I used to be a casual, supermarket teabag drinker - chamomile, rooibos etc.

I only recently started buying loose leaves and sample packs from T2, and I've been mostly enjoying them. T2 introduced me to lapsang souchong and genmaicha which I love.

Some of their other teas I've liked are:

- French Earl Grey
- Jade Mountain
- GMC Sencha
- Pumping Pomegranate
- Gorgeous Geisha
- New York Breakfast

I was surprised to read a lot of negative reviews on teas I liked on their website. A lot of the criticism seems to be about their teas being overpriced and 'basic' or maybe a bit pretentious even? Fwiw I don't think T2 ever pushed for some sort of prestigious reputation, a lot of their teas are quite fun - they just put out a cola tea.

2809,tea,"Hi there, it's my first time in this sub but I've always enjoyed tea and getting more interested in different types lately :)
Sorry this is a bit vague of a description, but I tried a tea once when I was much younger, and I really liked it, but have no idea what type of tea it could have been. I'm looking for a general type rather than a specific brand because I know that would be impossible to narrow down at this point!


Here's what I remember:
It was brought back from a business trip to China, not sure what area.
It was in a pressed cake form in a paper wrapper.
The colour of the leaves was very dark brown, it looked like there were little sticks in it too, and there was also some kind of little red fruits in it.
The actual brewed liquid wasn't super dark, can't remember the colour exactly but it may have been brown to reddish. Not green or yellow.
The taste had no bitterness


That's all I know, unfortunately...
Any ideas from more experienced tea drinkers would be great, I've always wondered about it :)


I've had a look around and but haven't found any types of cake tea with fruits in it...
When I try to search it I mostly get results about actual fruit tea, or sometimes pu er with tangerine.


But I'm sure there were little red fruits, because I remember being surprised as I'd never had fruit tea before and thought it was some kind of Chinese luxury :D",Can anyone help identifying a tea I had before?,"Hi there, it's my first time in this sub but I've always enjoyed tea and getting more interested in different types lately :)

2813,tea,"I used to love the organic jasmine green from Little Red Cup but their most recent batch is disappointing: it's very different from its previous incarnation, with too much bitterness and a hint of a chemical flavor. (Their white peony tea is still excellent though, and I strongly recommend it.) 

Prior to that, I liked a mid-grade Ten Ren jasmine which was about $38/lb., but the Little Red Cup batch from a couple of years ago, at a similar price, was so much better that now it'll be hard to go back. What really made it stand out was that it was strong, but not too astringent. It had some floral flavor as you'd expect, but it was never asparagus-like and was totally free of any Brussels sprout flavor. Some jasmines are so light that they could almost pass for whites, but this one was distinctly and pungently in green territory, with a hint of a smoky or toasted flavor that didn't overwhelm it, but still some sweetness as well. This balanced well with the floral notes.

I've tried some others but nothing so far is quite right. Many of them, like the pearls from the Tao of Tea, are good, but a little too gentle and delicate for my tastes, and some are too soapy (too much jasmine, presumably). The jasmine from Oliver Pluff &amp; Co. comes closer, but isn't quite right either, though I do recommend it if you haven't tried it and you want a gentle and sweet one that isn't too expensive. 

Thanks for reading all this, and if you have any other recommendations, whether for jasmine or non-jasmine green teas with these criteria, let me know. Other flavor hints I enjoy (feel free to make fun of me since my tastes are a bit like a five-year-old's) include almond, macadamia, or pretty much any kind of nutty flavor, as well as corn, fruit, and honey, or anything sweet. I strongly dislike grassy or hay flavors, so I avoid Japanese teas entirely, and I'm not crazy about the Mao Jians I've tried; nor do I like woody flavors, so I avoid all cheap oolongs, and only indulge in an expensive one on rare occasions. I found a good one in Taiwan once! But I still don't drink that anywhere near as often as jasmine green tea.

I used to boil water on the stove with a small stainless steel teapot that I had for ages, and I recently bought a kettle.

I wanted to know if other kettle owners could share proper care tips. It's a simple electric stainless steel kettle.

The user's manual says to clean the interior of the kettle with mild dish soap after using, and also gives descaling instructions to be made every week.

I wanted to know in fact the down-to-Earth need of those actions, I mean, if it is really necessary to clean it after every use, since I use exclusively filtered water everytime. I use it approximately around 4 to 5 times a day. How often do you clean (with soap, I mean) the inside of thr kettle, and how often do you run descaling on yours?
